                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial in autonomous warehouse operations. Lifelong MAPF (L-MAPF), where agents are continuously reassigned new targets upon completing their current tasks, offers a more realistic approximation of real-world warehouse scenarios. While cache storage systems can enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs, existing approaches primarily rely on expectations and mathematical models, often without adequately addressing the challenges of multi-robot planning and execution. In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism called Lifelong MAPF with Cache Mechanism (L-MAPF-CM), which integrates high-level cache storage with low-level path planning. We have involved a new type of map grid called cache for temporary item storage. Additionally, we involved a task assigner (TA) with a locking mechanism to bridge the gap between the new cache grid and L-MAPF algorithm. The TA dynamically allocates target locations to agents based on their status in various scenarios. We evaluated L-MAPF-CM using different cache replacement policies and task distributions. L-MAPF-CM has demonstrated performance improvements particularly with high cache hit rates and smooth traffic conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a promising technology for memory disaggregation and expansion. Especially, CXL makes it more effectively for large-capacity storage devices such as Solid State Drive (SSD) to be deployed in the memory pool. However, CXL-based SSDs are still in early stages, necessitating the development of reliable simulation tools. In this paper, we propose CXL-SSD-Sim, the first open-source full-system simulator designed to simulate CXL-based SSD memory system. Constructed on the foundation of gem5 and SimpleSSD, CXL-SSD-Sim extends an high fidelity SSD memory expander model along with the corresponding device driver. In addition, CXL-SSD-Sim models a DRAM layer as a caching mechanism for the SSD, meticulously engineered to counteract latency issues inherent to CXL-based SSD memory access. Experiments are performed among five different memory devices with CXL-SSD-Sim in aspect of latency, bandwidth and real-world benchmark performance. These experiments serve to underscore the efficacy of our simulation tool in providing a comprehensive analysis of CXL-based SSD memory systems. The CXL-SSD-Sim simulator is available at https://github.com/WangYaohuii/CXL-SSD-Sim.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) with enormous model sizes use many GPUs to meet memory capacity requirements incurring substantial costs for token generation. To provide cost-effective LLM inference with relaxed latency constraints, extensive research has focused on expanding GPU memory by leveraging the host memory. However, LLM inference engines that utilize the host memory often face underutilization of GPU compute units, as a considerable portion of inference time is spent in loading the model onto the GPU via host-GPU interconnect. To tackle these challenges of the host memory offloading for LLM, we introduce HybridServe, an LLM inference system with activation checkpointing based on activation caching. The activation cache stores activation checkpoints generated during intermediate inference stages, allowing the fast recomputation of KV cache while model parameters are transferred to GPU from host memory. Unlike conventional methods that recompute the KV cache from scratch using token IDs, the activation cache allows bypassing projection and FFN operations. To balance between the activation recomputation and parameter loading overhead, this study proposes a KV-activation hybrid caching scheme which finds the best ratio of the key-value and activation caches to adjust the recomputation time. Our system achieves 2.19x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art prior work for offloading both model weights and KV cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating high-quality, high-dimensional images. Nevertheless, these models are hindered by their high computational cost and slow inference, partly due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention mechanisms with respect to input size. Various approaches have been proposed to address this drawback. One such approach focuses on reducing the number of tokens fed into the self-attention, known as token merging (ToMe). In our method, which is called cached adaptive token merging(CA-ToMe), we calculate the similarity between tokens and then merge the r proportion of the most similar tokens. However, due to the repetitive patterns observed in adjacent steps and the variation in the frequency of similarities, we aim to enhance this approach by implementing an adaptive threshold for merging tokens and adding a caching mechanism that stores similar pairs across several adjacent steps. Empirical results demonstrate that our method operates as a training-free acceleration method, achieving a speedup factor of 1.24 in the denoising process while maintaining the same FID scores compared to existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.

In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stable Diffusion has achieved remarkable success in the field of text-to-image generation, with its powerful generative capabilities and diverse generation results making a lasting impact. However, its iterative denoising introduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting broader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this computational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention due to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features computed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to become similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately compromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a dynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of feature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing only high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby extending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with token pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise information reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach delivered a 9$\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced image quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\times$ acceleration coupled with a notable FID reduction of 2.17.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ultra-fine-grained image recognition (UFGIR) is a challenging task that involves classifying images within a macro-category. While traditional FGIR deals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying sub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times the usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain outstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a significant cost in terms of computation specially since this task significantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore, techniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational cost. However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for fine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced. Therefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token reduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a Cross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous layers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs across diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction methods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy vs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to 10\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1]. The proposed framework operates within the storage kernel, ensuring minimal latency and low computational overhead. Through an adaptive feedback mechanism, RL-Storage dynamically adjusts critical parameters, achieving efficient resource utilization across a wide range of workloads. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of benchmarks, including RocksDB and PostgreSQL, demonstrate significant improvements, with throughput gains of up to 2.6x and latency reductions of 43% compared to baseline heuristics. Additionally, RL-Storage achieves these performance enhancements with a negligible CPU overhead of 0.11% and a memory footprint of only 5 KB, making it suitable for seamless deployment in production environments. This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Network simulators are indispensable tools for the advancement of wireless network technologies, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment to simulate real-world network behavior. However, traditional simulators, such as the widely used ns-3, exhibit limitations in accurately modeling indoor and outdoor scenarios due to their reliance on simplified statistical and stochastic channel propagation models, which often fail to accurately capture physical phenomena like multipath signal propagation and shadowing by obstacles in the line-of-sight path. We present Ns3Sionna, which integrates a ray tracing-based channel model, implemented using the Sionna RT framework, within the ns-3 network simulator. It allows to simulate environment-specific and physically accurate channel realizations for a given 3D scene and wireless device positions. Additionally, a mobility model based on ray tracing was developed to accurately represent device movements within the simulated 3D space. Ns3Sionna provides more realistic path and delay loss estimates for both indoor and outdoor environments than existing ns-3 propagation models, particularly in terms of spatial and temporal correlation. Moreover, fine-grained channel state information is provided, which could be used for the development of sensing applications. Due to the significant computational demands of ray tracing, Ns3Sionna takes advantage of the parallel execution capabilities of modern GPUs and multi-core CPUs by incorporating intelligent pre-caching mechanisms that leverage the channel's coherence time to optimize runtime performance. This enables the efficient simulation of scenarios with a small to medium number of mobile nodes.

TTLs have become the de-facto mechanism used to keep cached data reasonably fresh (i.e., not too out of date with the backend). However, the emergence of real-time applications requires tighter data freshness, which is impractical to achieve with TTLs. We discuss why this is the case, and propose a simple yet effective adaptive policy to achieve the desired freshness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance their perceptual capabilities by integrating visual and textual information. However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In a federated learning (FL) system, many devices, such as smartphones, are often undependable (e.g., frequently disconnected from WiFi) during training. Existing FL frameworks always assume a dependable environment and exclude undependable devices from training, leading to poor model performance and resource wastage. In this paper, we propose FLUDE to effectively deal with undependable environments. First, FLUDE assesses the dependability of devices based on the probability distribution of their historical behaviors (e.g., the likelihood of successfully completing training). Based on this assessment, FLUDE adaptively selects devices with high dependability for training. To mitigate resource wastage during the training phase, FLUDE maintains a model cache on each device, aiming to preserve the latest training state for later use in case local training on an undependable device is interrupted. Moreover, FLUDE proposes a staleness-aware strategy to judiciously distribute the global model to a subset of devices, thus significantly reducing resource wastage while maintaining model performance. We have implemented FLUDE on two physical platforms with 120 smartphones and NVIDIA Jetson devices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLUDE can effectively improve model performance and resource efficiency of FL training in undependable environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Even in the era of Deep Learning based methods, traditional machine learning methods with large data sets continue to attract significant attention. However, we find an apparent lack of a detailed performance characterization of these methods in the context of large training datasets. In this work, we study the system's behavior of a number of traditional ML methods as implemented in popular free software libraries/modules to identify critical performance bottlenecks experienced by these applications. The performance characterization study reveals several interesting insights on the performance of these applications. Then we evaluate the performance benefits of applying some well-known optimizations at the levels of caches and the main memory. More specifically, we test the usefulness of optimizations such as (i) software prefetching to improve cache performance and (ii) data layout and computation reordering optimizations to improve locality in DRAM accesses. These optimizations are implemented as modifications to the well-known scikit-learn library, and hence can be easily leveraged by application programmers. We evaluate the impact of the proposed optimizations using a combination of simulation and execution on a real system. The software prefetching optimization results in performance benefits varying from 5.2%-27.1% on different ML applications while the data layout and computation reordering approaches yield 6.16%-28.0% performance improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a Unity based benchmark XRFlux for evaluating Virtual Reality (VR) delivery systems using edge-cloud caching. As VR applications and systems progress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud architectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet these demands, especially for users of the same application in different locations. With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in efforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with changing fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates various challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks and propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging users' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The benchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to assess the resulting QoEs. This tool fills a gap by supporting research in the optimization of edge caching (and other edge-cloud functions) for VR streaming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. We present PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize our approach to new tasks with minimal effort.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes integrating Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) into Julia, a language widely used in scientific and High-Performance Computing (HPC). AOP enhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects. Leveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed to operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package. AspectJulia enables developers to define and apply aspects seamlessly, leading to more modular, maintainable, and adaptable code. We detail the implementation of AspectJulia and present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to business applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing cross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and improves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the way for more efficient and maintainable software systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in solving various natural language processing tasks and are now widely offered as services. LLM services enable users to accomplish tasks without requiring specialized knowledge, simply by paying service providers. However, numerous providers offer various LLM services with variations in pricing, latency, and performance. These factors are also affected by different invocation methods, such as the choice of context and the use of cache, which lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable service cost and quality. Consequently, utilizing various LLM services invocation methods to construct an effective (cost-saving, low-latency and high-performance) invocation strategy that best meets task demands becomes a pressing challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods help LLM services to be invoked efficiently. Technically, we define the problem of constructing an effective LLM services invocation strategy, and based on this, propose a unified LLM service invocation framework. The framework classifies existing methods into four categories: input abstraction, semantic cache, solution design, and output enhancement, which can be used separately or jointly during the invocation life cycle. We discuss the methods in each category and compare them to provide valuable guidance for researchers. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges in this domain and shed light on future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learned lossless image compression has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on training amortized generative models on massive datasets, resulting in sub-optimal probability distribution estimation for specific testing images during encoding process. To address this challenge, we explore the connection between the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), leading to the development of a novel content-adaptive approach for learned lossless image compression, dubbed CALLIC. Specifically, we first propose a content-aware autoregressive self-attention mechanism by leveraging convolutional gating operations, termed Masked Gated ConvFormer (MGCF), and pretrain MGCF on training dataset. Cache then Crop Inference (CCI) is proposed to accelerate the coding process. During encoding, we decompose pre-trained layers, including depth-wise convolutions, using low-rank matrices and then adapt the incremental weights on testing image by Rate-guided Progressive Fine-Tuning (RPFT). RPFT fine-tunes with gradually increasing patches that are sorted in descending order by estimated entropy, optimizing learning process and reducing adaptation time. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that CALLIC sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for learned lossless image compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the compute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the serving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable performance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are cached at all the host for autoscaling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Virtual-to-physical address translation is a critical performance bottleneck in paging-based virtual memory systems. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) accelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but TLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address this challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level support, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement policies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries (PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from incorrect predictions. Integrating an Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP) with SBFP optimizes performance by leveraging page table locality and dynamically identifying essential free PTEs during page walks. Predictive replacement policies further improve TLB performance. Traditional LRU replacement is limited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP, SHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies. CHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control flow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning instead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key challenges in virtual memory management.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

These optimizations extend the lifespan and domain of the KV cache, necessitating a new architectural approach. We present MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations. MemServe introduces MemPool, an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances. Using MemPool APIs, MemServe combines context caching with disaggregated inference for the first time, supported by a global scheduler that enhances cache reuse through a global prompt tree-based locality-aware policy. Tests show that MemServe significantly improves job completion time and time-to-first-time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of contents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate. Despite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including not only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the extensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known about the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general NP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise statements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our results include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the conditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications such as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Important memory-bound kernels, such as linear algebra, convolutions, and stencils, rely on SIMD instructions as well as optimizations targeting improved vectorized data traversal and data re-use to attain satisfactory performance. On on temporary CPU architectures, the hardware prefetcher is of key importance for efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single stride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the utilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of memory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we establish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache lines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache hit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of costly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided variants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform state-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More specifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution Stencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to 12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and 1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided memory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange techniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instance segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are typically based on conventional methods, limiting their application to seen scenarios and closed-set predictions. In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance in solving complex math problems with a divide-and-conquer pipeline and the assistance of in-context learning (ICL) examples. However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly. Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing. 2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of Generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) raised the alarm regarding identifying content produced through generative AI or humans. In one case, issues arise when students heavily rely on such tools in a manner that can affect the development of their writing or coding skills. Other issues of plagiarism also apply. This study aims to support efforts to detect and identify textual content generated using LLM tools. We hypothesize that LLMs-generated text is detectable by machine learning (ML), and investigate ML models that can recognize and differentiate texts generated by multiple LLMs tools. We leverage several ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the important features in attribution. Our method is divided into 1) binary classification to differentiate between human-written and AI-text, and 2) multi classification, to differentiate between human-written text and the text generated by the five different LLM tools (ChatGPT, LLaMA, Google Bard, Claude, and Perplexity). Results show high accuracy in the multi and binary classification. Our model outperformed GPTZero with 98.5\% accuracy to 78.3\%. Notably, GPTZero was unable to recognize about 4.2\% of the observations, but our model was able to recognize the complete test dataset. XAI results showed that understanding feature importance across different classes enables detailed author/source profiles. Further, aiding in attribution and supporting plagiarism detection by highlighting unique stylistic and structural elements ensuring robust content originality verification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Let $K$ be the field of fractions of a complete discrete valuation ring with a perfect residue field. In this article, we investigate how the Tamagawa number of $E/K$ changes under quadratic twist. To accomplish this, we introduce the notion of a normal model for $E/K$, which is a Weierstrass model satisfying certain conditions that lead one to easily infer the local data of $E/K$. Our main results provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the Weierstrass coefficients of a normal model of $E/K$ to determine the local data of a quadratic twist $E^{d}/K$. We note that when the residue field has characteristic $2$, we only consider the special case $K=\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. In this setting, we also determine the minimal discriminant valuation and conductor exponent of $E$ and $E^d$ from further conditions on the coefficients of a normal model for $E$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study seeks to enhance academic integrity by providing tools to detect AI-generated content in student work using advanced technologies. The findings promote transparency and accountability, helping educators maintain ethical standards and supporting the responsible integration of AI in education. A key contribution of this work is the generation of the CyberHumanAI dataset, which has 1000 observations, 500 of which are written by humans and the other 500 produced by ChatGPT. We evaluate various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on the CyberHumanAI dataset comparing human-written and AI-generated content from Large Language Models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT). Results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve high performance (83% and 81% accuracies respectively). Results also show that classifying shorter content seems to be more challenging than classifying longer content. Further, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we identify discriminative features influencing the ML model's predictions, where human-written content tends to use a practical language (e.g., use and allow). Meanwhile AI-generated text is characterized by more abstract and formal terms (e.g., realm and employ). Finally, a comparative analysis with GPTZero show that our narrowly focused, simple, and fine-tuned model can outperform generalized systems like GPTZero. The proposed model achieved approximately 77.5% accuracy compared to GPTZero's 48.5% accuracy when tasked to classify Pure AI, Pure Human, and mixed class. GPTZero showed a tendency to classify challenging and small-content cases as either mixed or unrecognized while our proposed model showed a more balanced performance across the three classes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce FACTS Grounding, an online leaderboard and associated benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to generate text that is factually accurate with respect to given context in the user prompt. In our benchmark, each prompt includes a user request and a full document, with a maximum length of 32k tokens, requiring long-form responses. The long-form responses are required to be fully grounded in the provided context document while fulfilling the user request. Models are evaluated using automated judge models in two phases: (1) responses are disqualified if they do not fulfill the user request; (2) they are judged as accurate if the response is fully grounded in the provided document. The automated judge models were comprehensively evaluated against a held-out test-set to pick the best prompt template, and the final factuality score is an aggregate of multiple judge models to mitigate evaluation bias. The FACTS Grounding leaderboard will be actively maintained over time, and contains both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding the integrity of the leaderboard.

In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale roughly eighteen fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.24} (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a widely adopted approach to mitigate the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in answering domain-specific questions. Previous research has predominantly focused on improving the accuracy and quality of retrieved data chunks to enhance the overall performance of the generation pipeline. However, despite ongoing advancements, the critical issue of retrieving irrelevant information -- which can impair the ability of the model to utilize its internal knowledge effectively -- has received minimal attention. In this work, we investigate the impact of retrieving irrelevant information in open-domain question answering, highlighting its significant detrimental effect on the quality of LLM outputs. To address this challenge, we propose the Context Awareness Gate (CAG) architecture, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts the LLMs' input prompt based on whether the user query necessitates external context retrieval. Additionally, we introduce the Vector Candidates method, a core mathematical component of CAG that is statistical, LLM-independent, and highly scalable. We further examine the distributions of relationships between contexts and questions, presenting a statistical analysis of these distributions. This analysis can be leveraged to enhance the context retrieval process in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The nEDM experiment at the SNS (nEDM@SNS) is the first measurement of the neutron EDM to directly measure the precession frequency of the neutron spin due to magnetic and electric fields. Previous measurements have inferred the precession frequency by measuring the residual polarization of neutrons after a long period of free precession. This difference provides independent information on potential unknown systematic uncertainties compared to previous and on-going measurements. It is precisely because nEDM@SNS is using a number of novel techniques, that it is essential to perform detailed studies of these techniques in order to optimize the statistical sensitivity and minimize the systematic uncertainty. The Systematic and Operational Studies Apparatus (SOSA) was one of the main efforts of nEDM@SNS collaboration, concentrated on development of a cryogenic test-bed for learning precise manipulation of spins and studing systematic effects of the proposed new technique. The test bed does not need an electric field but designed to have full NMR capability to the same level as nEDM@SNS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [Notice: This version is outdated. Recent research contradicts some key claims; we are working on a major revision with more nuanced analysis. Please wait for the updated version.]   While LLMs excel at multi-hop questions (e.g. "Who is the spouse of the performer of Imagine?") when using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT), they struggle when forced to reason internally (without CoT). Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations. However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9% to 79.8%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on large-scale pretrained foundation models (PFMs) such as vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models and vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated the ability to solve complex and truly non-trivial AI problems in a wide variety of domains and contexts. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating diverse personas to create these training scenarios. However, little is known about how LLMs can be developed to simulate victims for scenario-based training purposes. In this paper, we introduce VicSim (victim simulator), a novel model that addresses three key dimensions of user simulation: informational faithfulness, emotional dynamics, and language style (e.g., grammar usage). We pioneer the integration of scenario-based victim modeling with GAN-based training workflow and key-information-based prompting, aiming to enhance the realism of simulated victims. Our adversarial training approach teaches the discriminator to recognize grammar and emotional cues as reliable indicators of synthetic content. According to evaluations by human raters, the VicSim model outperforms GPT-4 in terms of human-likeness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in LLMs' "realistic" reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and the creation of high-quality tests that adhere to best practices is essential for effective maintenance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases. However, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a novel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show that LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward models for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a time. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model aimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By comparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated high-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to 21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on four out of seven metrics. This represents a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of software testing through Reinforcement Learning and static quality metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in applying LLMs to scientific tasks. In this work, we conduct an experimental study to explore applicability of LLMs for configuring, annotating, translating, explaining, and generating scientific workflows. We use 5 different workflow specific experiments and evaluate several open- and closed-source language models using state-of-the-art workflow systems. Our studies reveal that LLMs often struggle with workflow related tasks due to their lack of knowledge of scientific workflows. We further observe that the performance of LLMs varies across experiments and workflow systems. Our findings can help workflow developers and users in understanding LLMs capabilities in scientific workflows, and motivate further research applying LLMs to workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $<0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software testing is a crucial but time-consuming aspect of software development, and recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for automated test case generation. However, because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of open-source code, they often generate test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality unit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics. First, we analyzed LLM-generated tests and show that LLMs frequently do generate undesirable test smells -- up to 37% of the time. Then, we implemented lightweight static analysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to optimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test cases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated nearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all code quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model. We provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automated software testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, execution of arbitrary code, and suspicious domain categories as the top detected malicious packages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most existing image tokenizers encode images into a fixed number of tokens or patches, overlooking the inherent variability in image complexity. To address this, we introduce Content-Adaptive Tokenizer (CAT), which dynamically adjusts representation capacity based on the image content and encodes simpler images into fewer tokens. We design a caption-based evaluation system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to predict content complexity and determine the optimal compression ratio for a given image, taking into account factors critical to human perception. Trained on images with diverse compression ratios, CAT demonstrates robust performance in image reconstruction. We also utilize its variable-length latent representations to train Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for ImageNet generation. By optimizing token allocation, CAT improves the FID score over fixed-ratio baselines trained with the same flops and boosts the inference throughput by 18.5%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is widely recognized as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm due to its model-sharing mechanism that avoids direct data exchange. However, model training inevitably leaves exploitable traces that can be used to infer sensitive information. In Decentralized FL (DFL), the overlay topology significantly influences its models' convergence, robustness, and security. This study explores the feasibility of inferring the overlay topology of DFL systems based solely on model behavior, introducing a novel Topology Inference Attack. A taxonomy of topology inference attacks is proposed, categorizing them by the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. Practical attack strategies are developed for different scenarios, and quantitative experiments are conducted to identify key factors influencing the attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that analyzing only the public models of individual nodes can accurately infer the DFL topology, underscoring the risk of sensitive information leakage in DFL systems. This finding offers valuable insights for improving privacy preservation in decentralized learning environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We tackle the efficiency problem of learning local feature matching. Recent advancements have given rise to purely CNN-based and transformer-based approaches, each augmented with deep learning techniques. While CNN-based methods often excel in matching speed, transformer-based methods tend to provide more accurate matches. We propose an efficient transformer-based network architecture for local feature matching. This technique is built on constructing multiple homography hypotheses to approximate the continuous correspondence in the real world and uni-directional cross-attention to accelerate the refinement. On the YFCC100M dataset, our matching accuracy is competitive with LoFTR, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, while the inference speed is boosted to 4 times, even outperforming the CNN-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on other open datasets such as Megadepth, ScanNet, and HPatches demonstrate our method's efficacy, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance a wide array of downstream applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Imbalanced classification and spurious correlation are common challenges in data science and machine learning. Both issues are linked to data imbalance, with certain groups of data samples significantly underrepresented, which in turn would compromise the accuracy, robustness and generalizability of the learned models. Recent advances have proposed leveraging the flexibility and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically built on transformer architectures, to generate synthetic samples and to augment the observed data. In the context of imbalanced data, LLMs are used to oversample underrepresented groups and have shown promising improvements. However, there is a clear lack of theoretical understanding of such synthetic data approaches. In this article, we develop novel theoretical foundations to systematically study the roles of synthetic samples in addressing imbalanced classification and spurious correlation. Specifically, we first explicitly quantify the benefits of synthetic oversampling. Next, we analyze the scaling dynamics in synthetic data augmentation, and derive the corresponding scaling law. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of transformer models to generate high-quality synthetic samples. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy of the LLM-based synthetic oversampling and augmentation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel approach to automated proof generation for the TLA+ Proof System (TLAPS) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method combines two key components: a sub-proof obligation generation phase that breaks down complex proof obligations into simpler sub-obligations, and a proof generation phase that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation with verified proof examples. We evaluate our approach using proof obligations from varying complexity levels of proof obligations, spanning from fundamental arithmetic properties to the properties of algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that while the method successfully generates valid proofs for intermediate-complexity obligations, it faces limitations with more complex theorems. These results indicate that our approach can effectively assist in proof development for certain classes of properties, contributing to the broader goal of integrating LLMs into formal verification workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been gaining a lot of interest due to their adaptability and extensibility in emerging applications, including communication networks. It is anticipated that ZSM networks will be able to support LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency communications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are vulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of LLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the security vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in ZSM networks, in particular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an attack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker has access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the membership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can lead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on named entity recognition task. Based on the experimental analysis, we discuss possible defense mechanisms and present possible research directions to make the LLMs more trustworthy in the context of ZSM networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) world, manufacturers or integrators must be aware of the security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications. To provide tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications (for the European context) is very useful. We here address the development of this ontology. Due to the very high number and size of the considered specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology. The first step is a manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual translation to XML/XSD is operated. We have developed a tool allowing us to convert this semi-structured data into an ontology. Because the different specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the creation of similar instances in the ontology. To improve the ontology simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs. The responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct responses. The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting point for a manual correction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> On September 5, 2022, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\sim$1~MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents econometric tools to unpack the treatment effect heterogeneity of punishing misdemeanor offenses on time-to-recidivism. We show how one can identify, estimate, and make inferences on the distributional, quantile, and average marginal treatment effects in setups where the treatment selection is endogenous and the outcome of interest, usually a duration variable, is potentially right-censored. We explore our proposed econometric methodology to evaluate the effect of fines and community service sentences as a form of punishment on time-to-recidivism in the State of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019, leveraging the as-if random assignment of judges to cases. Our results highlight substantial treatment effect heterogeneity that other tools are not meant to capture. For instance, we find that people whom most judges would punish take longer to recidivate as a consequence of the punishment, while people who would be punished only by strict judges recidivate at an earlier date than if they were not punished.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Structured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data. Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study emphasizes the significance of exploring distance-based source separation (DSS) in outdoor environments. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on indoor settings, the proposed model is designed to capture the unique characteristics of outdoor audio sources. It incorporates advanced techniques, including a two-stage conformer block, a linear relation-aware self-attention (RSA), and a TensorFlow Lite GPU delegate. While the linear RSA may not capture physical cues as explicitly as the quadratic RSA, the linear RSA enhances the model's context awareness, leading to improved performance on the DSS that requires an understanding of physical cues in outdoor and indoor environments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and considerably enhances energy efficiency and real-time inference speed on mobile devices.

In the paper, we first analyze some of the shortcomings of current LLMs (Large Language Model) and propose ideas for improvement. Then we analyze why our scheme can solve the above problems and provide detailed steps for implementing our scheme. In chapter 4, we have presented a step-by-step mplementation roadmap. And in chapter 5, we have presented a specific implementation demonstration. In chapter 6, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of our scheme and propose further research directions. In this article, we have put forward how to create genuine artificial general intelligence step by step. It can handle data of all modalities in a unified form and can directly understand the experience that humans already possess through language, thus avoiding the problem that reinforcement learning is required for every decision-making process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense.

However, their substantial computational requirements present challenges for practical deployment. Model quantization has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce memory usage and computational costs by employing lower precision and bit-width representations. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. We introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework that qualitatively assesses specific capability dimensions and conduct quantitative analyses on the step-by-step outputs of various quantization methods. Our results demonstrate that quantization differentially affects numerical computation and reasoning planning abilities, identifying key areas where quantized models experience performance degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulations of the dark matter distribution throughout the Universe are essential in order to analyse data from cosmological surveys. $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and many cheaper alternatives (such as lognormal random fields) fail to reproduce accurate statistics of the smaller, non-linear scales. In this work, we present \textsc{Psi-GAN} (\textbf{P}ower-\textbf{s}pectrum-\textbf{i}nformed \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etwork), a machine learning model which takes a two-dimensional lognormal dark matter density field and transforms it into a more realistic field. We construct \textsc{Psi-GAN} so that it is continuously conditional, and can therefore generate realistic realisations of the dark matter density field across a range of cosmologies and redshifts in $z \in [0, 3]$. We train \textsc{Psi-GAN} as a generative adversarial network on $2\,000$ simulation boxes from the Quijote simulation suite. We use a novel critic architecture that utilises the power spectrum as the basis for discrimination between real and generated samples. \textsc{Psi-GAN} shows agreement with $N$-body simulations over a range of redshifts and cosmologies, consistently outperforming the lognormal approximation on all tests of non-linear structure, such as being able to reproduce both the power spectrum up to wavenumbers of $1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the bispectra of target $N$-body simulations to within ${\sim}5$ per cent. Our improved ability to model non-linear structure should allow more robust constraints on cosmological parameters when used in techniques such as simulation-based inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal LLMs have reached remarkable levels of proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs, driving extensive research to develop increasingly powerful models. However, much less attention has been paid to understanding and explaining the underlying mechanisms of these models. Most existing explainability research examines these models only in their final states, overlooking the dynamic representational shifts that occur during training. In this work, we systematically analyze the evolution of hidden state representations to reveal how fine-tuning alters the internal structure of a model to specialize in new multimodal tasks. Using a concept-based approach, we map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts, enabling us to trace changes in encoded concepts across modalities as training progresses. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by shifting those in the original model. Finally, we explore the practical impact of our findings on model steering, showing that we can adjust multimodal LLMs behaviors without any training, such as modifying answer types, captions style, or biasing the model toward specific responses. Our work sheds light on how multimodal representations evolve through fine-tuning and offers a new perspective for interpreting model adaptation in multimodal tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the significance of change-points within fully nonparametric regression contexts, with a particular focus on panel data where data generation processes vary across units, and error terms may display complex dependency structures. In our setting the threshold effect depends on one specific covariate, and we permit the true nonparametric regression to vary based on additional (latent) variables. We propose two uniform testing procedures: one to assess the existence of change-points and another to evaluate the uniformity of such effects across units. Our approach involves deriving a straightforward analytical expression to approximate the variance-covariance structure of change-point effects under general dependency conditions. Notably, when Gaussian approximations are made to these test statistics, the intricate dependency structures within the data can be safely disregarded owing to the localized nature of the statistics. This finding bears significant implications for obtaining critical values. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our tests exhibit excellent control over size and reasonable power performance in finite samples, irrespective of strong cross-sectional and weak serial dependency within the data. Furthermore, applying our tests to two datasets reveals the existence of significant nonsmooth effects in both cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial and challenging task. In this study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their parameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a black-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover input-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe behaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM responds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative response from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This black-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points, the discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address these challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to finetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased input-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory completions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific names under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for auditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables arbitrary translations across multiple languages by training a model with limited parameters using parallel data only. However, the performance of such MNMT models still lags behind that of large language models (LLMs), limiting their practicality. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing registering to achieve the new state-of-the-art of decoder-only MNMT models. Specifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target language, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and target tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation only pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source tokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale benchmark, show that our method outperforms related methods driven by optimizing multilingual representations. We further scale up and collect 9.3 billion sentence pairs across 24 languages from public datasets to pre-train two models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers). One of them, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with commercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we open-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT: https://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input. When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses. RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains. While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG. However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks. Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction. In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG. Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based. By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack. Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%. It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes. Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series representation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative sample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However, due to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of contrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time series data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard negative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during positive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several scientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with improved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning framework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning, this paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel non-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and negative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a prompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the embedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in the embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its frequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic relationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series datasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and end-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing contrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new insights into self-supervised representation learning for time series. The code is available at https://github.com/USTBInnovationPark/Frequency-masked-Embedding-Inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR S\'ersic index ($n$), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range $0.5\leq z\leq2.5$. We infer rest-frame near-IR S\'ersic profiles for $\approx 15.000$ galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical S\'ersic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median S\'ersic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies ($M_\star > 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$), which show an increase from $n\approx 2.5$ to $n\approx 4$ at $z<1$. High-mass galaxies have higher $n$ than lower-mass galaxies ($M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at $z>1$. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR $n$ at z>1 (but not at z<1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At $z>1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$ is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, vision language models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in video understanding. However, a crucial capability - fine-grained motion comprehension - remains under-explored in current benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose MotionBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained motion comprehension of video understanding models. MotionBench evaluates models' motion-level perception through six primary categories of motion-oriented question types and includes data collected from diverse sources, ensuring a broad representation of real-world video content. Experimental results reveal that existing VLMs perform poorly in understanding fine-grained motions. To enhance VLM's ability to perceive fine-grained motion within a limited sequence length of LLM, we conduct extensive experiments reviewing VLM architectures optimized for video feature compression and propose a novel and efficient Through-Encoder (TE) Fusion method. Experiments show that higher frame rate inputs and TE Fusion yield improvements in motion understanding, yet there is still substantial room for enhancement. Our benchmark aims to guide and motivate the development of more capable video understanding models, emphasizing the importance of fine-grained motion comprehension.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time-delayed differential equations (TDDEs) are widely used to model complex dynamic systems where future states depend on past states with a delay. However, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a challenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in real-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit limitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic techniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability and robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of identifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is directly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe leverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous spike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential equations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with accuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing the search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples, validating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) presents the challenge of identifying categories not seen during training. This task is crucial in domains where it is costly, prohibited, or simply not feasible to collect training data. ZSL depends on a mapping between the visual space and available semantic information. Prior works learn a mapping between spaces that can be exploited during inference. We contend, however, that the disparity between meticulously curated semantic spaces and the inherently noisy nature of real-world data remains a substantial and unresolved challenge. In this paper, we address this by introducing a Semantic Encoder-Enhanced Representations for Zero-Shot Learning (SEER-ZSL). We propose a hybrid strategy to address the generalization gap. First, we aim to distill meaningful semantic information using a probabilistic encoder, enhancing the semantic consistency and robustness. Second, we distill the visual space by exploiting the learned data distribution through an adversarially trained generator. Finally, we align the distilled information, enabling a mapping of unseen categories onto the true data manifold. We demonstrate empirically that this approach yields a model that outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of both generalization and benchmarks across diverse settings with small, medium, and large datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-resolution precipitation forecasts are crucial for providing accurate weather prediction and supporting effective responses to extreme weather events. Traditional numerical models struggle with stochastic subgrid-scale processes, while recent deep learning models often produce blurry results. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-inspired deep learning framework for high-resolution (0.05\textdegree{} $\times$ 0.05\textdegree{}) ensemble precipitation forecasting. Trained on ERA5 and CMPA high-resolution precipitation datasets, the framework integrates deterministic and probabilistic components. The deterministic model, based on a 3D SwinTransformer, captures average precipitation at mesoscale resolution and incorporates strategies to enhance performance, particularly for moderate to heavy rainfall. The probabilistic model employs conditional diffusion in latent space to account for uncertainties in residual precipitation at convective scales. During inference, ensemble members are generated by repeatedly sampling latent variables, enabling the model to represent precipitation uncertainty. Our model significantly enhances spatial resolution and forecast accuracy. Rank histogram shows that the ensemble system is reliable and unbiased. In a case study of heavy precipitation in southern China, the model outputs align more closely with observed precipitation distributions than ERA5, demonstrating superior capability in capturing extreme precipitation events. Additionally, 5-day real-time forecasts show good performance in terms of CSI scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unprecedented agility and dexterous manipulation have been demonstrated with controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), with a significant impact on legged and humanoid robots. Modern tooling and simulation platforms, such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances. This article focuses on demonstrating the applications of Isaac in local planning and obstacle avoidance as one of the most fundamental ways in which a mobile robot interacts with its environments. Although there is extensive research on proprioception-based RL policies, the article highlights less standardized and reproducible approaches to exteroception. At the same time, the article aims to provide a base framework for end-to-end local navigation policies and how a custom robot can be trained in such simulation environment. We benchmark end-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot Operating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by demonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac simulator to real-world robots. This is further evidenced by the tests with different simulated robots, which show the generalization of the learned policy. Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2, opening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local planners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the possibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for more complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most important steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local path planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing, and ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against the inference attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (Video-LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding videos. However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) has transformative potential in various domains, including recommender systems (RS). There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. However, previous efforts mainly focus on LLM as RS, which may face the challenge of intolerant inference costs by LLM. Recently, the integration of LLM into RS, known as LLM-Enhanced Recommender Systems (LLMERS), has garnered significant interest due to its potential to address latency and memory constraints in real-world applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest research efforts aimed at leveraging LLM to enhance RS capabilities. We identify a critical shift in the field with the move towards incorporating LLM into the online system, notably by avoiding their use during inference. Our survey categorizes the existing LLMERS approaches into three primary types based on the component of the RS model being augmented: Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement, and Model Enhancement. We provide an in-depth analysis of each category, discussing the methodologies, challenges, and contributions of recent studies. Furthermore, we highlight several promising research directions that could further advance the field of LLMERS.

To address these issues, we introduce a medical instruction dataset, CMedINS, containing six medical instructions derived from actual medical tasks, which effectively fine-tunes LLM in conjunction with other data. Subsequently, We launch our medical model, IIMedGPT, employing an efficient preference alignment method, Direct preference Optimization(DPO). The results show that our final model outperforms existing medical models in medical dialogue.Datsets, Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, pivotal to various applications such as query optimization, data integration, and schema matching. While neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and target labels frequently evolve based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to predict text labels. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. GORAG constructs and maintains an adaptive information graph by extracting side information across all target texts, rather than treating each input independently. It employs a weighted edge mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and accurate contextual information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Can LLMs pick up language structure from examples? Evidence in prior work seems to indicate yes, as pretrained models repeatedly demonstrate the ability to adapt to new language structures and vocabularies. However, this line of research typically considers languages that are present within common pretraining datasets, or otherwise share notable similarities with these seen languages. In contrast, in this work we attempt to measure models' language understanding capacity while circumventing the risk of dataset recall. We parameterize large families of language tasks recognized by deterministic finite automata (DFAs), and can thus sample novel language reasoning problems to fairly evaulate LLMs regardless of training data. We find that, even in the strikingly simple setting of 3-state DFAs, LLMs underperform unparameterized ngram models on both language recognition and synthesis tasks. These results suggest that LLMs struggle to match the ability of basic language models in recognizing and reasoning over languages that are sufficiently distinct from the ones they see at training time, underscoring the distinction between learning individual languages and possessing a general theory of language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT4o, have shown strong capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation. However, despite these strengths, they face significant challenges in the increasingly critical task of Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL). Moreover, existing IFDL methods are typically limited to the learning of low-level semantic-agnostic clues and merely provide a single outcome judgment. To tackle these issues, we propose ForgeryGPT, a novel framework that advances the IFDL task by capturing high-order forensics knowledge correlations of forged images from diverse linguistic feature spaces, while enabling explainable generation and interactive dialogue through a newly customized Large Language Model (LLM) architecture. Specifically, ForgeryGPT enhances traditional LLMs by integrating the Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor, which enables the excavating of precise forgery mask information from input images and facilitating pixel-level understanding of tampering artifacts. The Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor consists of a Forgery Localization Expert (FL-Expert) and a Mask Encoder, where the FL-Expert is augmented with an Object-agnostic Forgery Prompt and a Vocabulary-enhanced Vision Encoder, allowing for effectively capturing of multi-scale fine-grained forgery details. To enhance its performance, we implement a three-stage training strategy, supported by our designed Mask-Text Alignment and IFDL Task-Specific Instruction Tuning datasets, which align vision-language modalities and improve forgery detection and instruction-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs. Benchmarking results on 16 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Permanent magnet tracking using the external sensor array is crucial for the accurate localization of wireless capsule endoscope robots. Traditional tracking algorithms, based on the magnetic dipole model and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, face challenges related to computational delays and the need for initial position estimation. More recently proposed neural network-based approaches often require extensive hardware calibration and real-world data collection, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose MobilePosenet, a lightweight neural network architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to minimize computational cost and a channel attention mechanism to enhance localization accuracy. Besides, the inputs to the network integrate the sensors' coordinate information and random noise, compensating for the discrepancies between the theoretical model and the actual magnetic fields and thus allowing MobilePosenet to be trained entirely on theoretical data. Experimental evaluations conducted in a \(90 \times 90 \times 80\) mm workspace demonstrate that MobilePosenet exhibits excellent 5-DOF localization accuracy ($1.54 \pm 1.03$ mm and $2.24 \pm 1.84^{\circ}$) and inference speed (0.9 ms) against state-of-the-art methods trained on real-world data. Since network training relies solely on theoretical data, MobilePosenet can eliminate the hardware calibration and real-world data collection process, improving the generalizability of this permanent magnet localization method and the potential for rapid adoption in different clinical settings.

Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying deep neural networks for risk-sensitive tasks necessitates an uncertainty estimation mechanism. This paper introduces hierarchical selective classification, extending selective classification to a hierarchical setting. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of class relationships, enabling models to reduce the specificity of their predictions when faced with uncertainty. In this paper, we first formalize hierarchical risk and coverage, and introduce hierarchical risk-coverage curves. Next, we develop algorithms for hierarchical selective classification (which we refer to as "inference rules"), and propose an efficient algorithm that guarantees a target accuracy constraint with high probability. Lastly, we conduct extensive empirical studies on over a thousand ImageNet classifiers, revealing that training regimes such as CLIP, pretraining on ImageNet21k and knowledge distillation boost hierarchical selective performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes.The high-temporal resolution and asynchronicity of event cameras offer great potential for estimating robot motion states. Recent works have adopted the continuous-time estimation methods to exploit the inherent nature of event cameras. However, existing methods either have poor runtime performance or neglect the high-temporal resolution of event cameras. To alleviate it, an Asynchronous Event-driven Visual Odometry (AsynEVO) based on sparse Gaussian Process (GP) regression is proposed to efficiently infer the motion trajectory from pure event streams. Concretely, an asynchronous frontend pipeline is designed to adapt event-driven feature tracking and manage feature trajectories; a parallel dynamic sliding-window backend is presented within the framework of sparse GP regression on $SE(3)$. Notably, a dynamic marginalization strategy is employed to ensure the consistency and sparsity of this GP regression. Experiments conducted on public datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate that AsynEVO achieves competitive precision and superior robustness compared to the state-of-the-art.The experiment in the repeated-texture scenario indicates that the high-temporal resolution of AsynEVO plays a vital role in the estimation of high-speed movement. Furthermore, we show that the computational efficiency of AsynEVO significantly outperforms the incremental method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual proficiency presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). English-centric models are usually suboptimal in other languages, particularly those that are linguistically distant from English. This performance discrepancy mainly stems from the imbalanced distribution of training data across languages during pre-training and instruction tuning stages. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called CrossIn, which utilizes a mixed composition of cross-lingual instruction tuning data. Our method leverages the compressed representation shared by various languages to efficiently enhance the model's task-solving capabilities and multilingual proficiency within a single process. In addition, we introduce a multi-task and multi-faceted benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of CrossIn. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves performance across tasks and languages, and we provide extensive insights into the impact of cross-lingual data volume and the integration of translation data on enhancing multilingual consistency and accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of a multidisciplinary approach to testing and aligning artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid development and wide application of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment, controllability, and predictability of these models emerged as global risks. This study investigates an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital citizens,' simulating complex social structures and interactions to examine and optimize AI. Application of various theories from the fields of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible AI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social dynamics. This research endeavors to contribute to the development and refinement of AI, emphasizing the integration of social, ethical, and theoretical dimensions for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various reasoning tasks, yet building a single model that consistently excels across all domains remains challenging. This paper addresses this problem by exploring strategies to integrate multiple domain-specialized models into an efficient pivot model.We propose two fusion strategies to combine the strengths of multiple LLMs: (1) a pairwise, multi-step fusion approach that sequentially distills each source model into the pivot model, followed by a weight merging step to integrate the distilled models into the final model. This method achieves strong performance but requires substantial training effort; and (2) a unified fusion approach that aggregates all source models' outputs simultaneously.To improve the fusion process, we introduce a novel Rate-Skewness Adaptive Fusion (RSAF) technique, which dynamically adjusts top-K ratios during parameter merging for enhanced flexibility and stability.Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-based weighting method for the unified approach, which dynamically balances the contributions of source models and outperforms other logits/distribution ensemble methods.We achieved accuracy improvements of 9.27%, 8.80%, and 8.89% on the GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval tasks, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to generate a natural language explanation for the given sarcastic dialogue that involves multiple modalities (\ie utterance, video, and audio). Although existing studies have achieved great success based on the generative pretrained language model BART, they overlook exploiting the sentiments residing in the utterance, video and audio, which play important roles in reflecting sarcasm that essentially involves subtle sentiment contrasts. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to incorporate sentiments for boosting SED performance, due to three main challenges: 1) diverse effects of utterance tokens on sentiments; 2) gap between video-audio sentiment signals and the embedding space of BART; and 3) various relations among utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel sEntiment-enhanceD Graph-based multimodal sarcasm Explanation framework, named EDGE. In particular, we first propose a lexicon-guided utterance sentiment inference module, where a heuristic utterance sentiment refinement strategy is devised. We then develop a module named Joint Cross Attention-based Sentiment Inference (JCA-SI) by extending the multimodal sentiment analysis model JCA to derive the joint sentiment label for each video-audio clip. Thereafter, we devise a context-sentiment graph to comprehensively model the semantic relations among the utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments, to facilitate sarcasm explanation generation. Extensive experiments on the publicly released dataset WITS verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the dramatic upsurge in the volume of ultrasound examinations, low-quality ultrasound imaging has gradually increased due to variations in operator proficiency and imaging circumstances, imposing a severe burden on diagnosis accuracy and even entailing the risk of restarting the diagnosis in critical cases. To assist clinicians in selecting high-quality ultrasound images and ensuring accurate diagnoses, we introduce Ultrasound-QBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on quality assessment tasks of ultrasound images. Ultrasound-QBench establishes two datasets collected from diverse sources: IVUSQA, consisting of 7,709 images, and CardiacUltraQA, containing 3,863 images. These images encompassing common ultrasound imaging artifacts are annotated by professional ultrasound experts and classified into three quality levels: high, medium, and low. To better evaluate MLLMs, we decompose the quality assessment task into three dimensionalities: qualitative classification, quantitative scoring, and comparative assessment. The evaluation of 7 open-source MLLMs as well as 1 proprietary MLLMs demonstrates that MLLMs possess preliminary capabilities for low-level visual tasks in ultrasound image quality classification. We hope this benchmark will inspire the research community to delve deeper into uncovering and enhancing the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical imaging tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has led to substantial performance improvements. However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness to noisy and out-of-distribution data. These techniques expose the model to a broader range of patterns, improving its adaptability in generating recommendations with varying levels of diversity. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that DLCRec not only provides precise control over diversity but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous fake speech datasets were constructed from a defender's perspective to develop countermeasure (CM) systems without considering diverse motivations of attackers. To better align with real-life scenarios, we created LlamaPartialSpoof, a 130-hour dataset that contains both fully and partially fake speech, using a large language model (LLM) and voice cloning technologies to evaluate the robustness of CMs. By examining valuable information for both attackers and defenders, we identify several key vulnerabilities in current CM systems, which can be exploited to enhance attack success rates, including biases toward certain text-to-speech models or concatenation methods. Our experimental results indicate that the current fake speech detection system struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, achieving a best performance of 24.49% equal error rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text augmentation (TA) is a critical technique for text classification, especially in few-shot settings. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based TA method, TARDiS, to address challenges inherent in the generation and alignment stages of two-stage TA methods. For the generation stage, we propose two generation processes, SEG and CEG, incorporating multiple class-specific prompts to enhance diversity and separability. For the alignment stage, we introduce a class adaptation (CA) method to ensure that generated examples align with their target classes through verification and modification. Experimental results demonstrate TARDiS's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based TA methods in various few-shot text classification tasks. An in-depth analysis confirms the detailed behaviors at each stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The structural properties of naturally arising social graphs are extensively studied to understand their evolution. Prior approaches for modeling network dynamics typically rely on rule-based models, which lack realism and generalizability, or deep learning-based models, which require large-scale training datasets. Social graphs, as abstract graph representations of entity-wise interactions, present an opportunity to explore network evolution mechanisms through realistic simulations of human-item interactions. Leveraging the pre-trained social consensus knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs), we present GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic, text-attributed social graph generation. GAG simulates the temporal node and edge generation processes for zero-shot social graph generation. The resulting graphs exhibit adherence to seven key macroscopic network properties, achieving an 11% improvement in microscopic graph structure metrics. Through the node classification benchmarking task, we validate GAG effectively captures the intricate text-structure correlations in graph generation. Furthermore, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation with parallel acceleration, achieving a minimum speed-up of 90.4%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various tasks, including knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, current studies mostly apply LLMs to classification tasks, like identifying missing triplets, rather than ranking-based tasks, where the model ranks candidate entities based on plausibility. This focus limits the practical use of LLMs in KGC, as real-world applications prioritize highly plausible triplets. Additionally, while graph paths can help infer the existence of missing triplets and improve completion accuracy, they often contain redundant information. To address these issues, we propose KG-CF, a framework tailored for ranking-based KGC tasks. KG-CF leverages LLMs' reasoning abilities to filter out irrelevant contexts, achieving superior results on real-world datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks by understanding input information and predicting corresponding outputs. However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a powerful and non-random methodology for novelty detection, offering distribution-free false discovery rate (FDR) control guarantees. Building on the full-conformal inference framework and the concept of e-values, we introduce full-conformal e-values to quantify evidence for novelty relative to a given reference dataset. These e-values are then utilized by carefully crafted multiple testing procedures to identify a set of novel units out-of-sample with provable finite-sample FDR control. Furthermore, our method is extended to address distribution shift, accommodating scenarios where novelty detection must be performed on data drawn from a shifted distribution relative to the reference dataset. In all settings, our method is non-random and can perform powerfully with limited amounts of reference data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods for novelty detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a novel architecture for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve Question Answering (QA) tasks from a target corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the analyzing and generation of human-like text. These models rely on pre-trained data and lack real-time updates unless integrated with live data tools. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating online resources and databases to generate contextually appropriate responses. However, traditional RAG still encounters challenges like information dilution and hallucinations when handling vast amounts of data. Our approach addresses these challenges by converting corpora into a domain-specific dataset and RAG architecture is constructed to generate responses from the target document. We introduce QuIM-RAG (Question-to-question Inverted Index Matching), a novel approach for the retrieval mechanism in our system. This strategy generates potential questions from document chunks and matches these with user queries to identify the most relevant text chunks for generating accurate answers. We have implemented our RAG system on top of the open-source Meta-LLaMA3-8B-instruct model by Meta Inc. that is available on Hugging Face. We constructed a custom corpus of 500+ pages from a high-traffic website accessed thousands of times daily for answering complex questions, along with manually prepared ground truth QA for evaluation. We compared our approach with traditional RAG models using BERT-Score and RAGAS, state-of-the-art metrics for evaluating LLM applications. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional RAG architectures on both metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models and vision transformers have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities, enabling significant transferability in downstream tasks. The fusion of these models has resulted in multi-modal architectures with enhanced instructional capabilities. Despite incorporating vast image and language pre-training, these multi-modal architectures often generate responses that deviate from the ground truth in the image data. These failure cases are known as hallucinations. Current methods for mitigating hallucinations generally focus on regularizing the language component, improving the fusion module, or ensembling multiple visual encoders to improve visual representation. In this paper, we address the hallucination issue by directly enhancing the capabilities of the visual component. Our approach, named EAGLE, is fully agnostic to the LLM or fusion module and works as a post-pretraining approach that improves the grounding and language alignment of the visual encoder. We show that a straightforward reformulation of the original contrastive pre-training task results in an improved visual encoder that can be incorporated into the instructional multi-modal architecture without additional instructional training. As a result, EAGLE achieves a significant reduction in hallucinations across multiple challenging benchmarks and tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/GS-DiT/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study develops a systematic approach for evaluating the effect of a treatment on a time-to-event outcome in a matched-pair study. While most methods for paired right-censored outcomes allow determining an overall treatment effect over the course of follow-up, they generally lack in providing detailed insights into how the effect changes over time. To address this gap, we propose novel tests for paired right-censored outcomes using randomization inference. We further extend our tests to matched observational studies by developing corresponding sensitivity analysis methods to take into account departures from randomization. Simulations demonstrate the robustness of our approach against various non-proportional hazards alternatives, including a crossing survival curves scenario. We demonstrate the application of our methods using a matched observational study from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) data, focusing on the effect of social engagement on survival.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the task of comparing two classification algorithms, the widely-used McNemar's test aims to infer the presence of a significant difference between the error rates of the two classification algorithms. However, the power of the conventional McNemar's test is usually unpromising because the hold-out (HO) method in the test merely uses a single train-validation split that usually produces a highly varied estimation of the error rates. In contrast, a cross-validation (CV) method repeats the HO method in multiple times and produces a stable estimation. Therefore, a CV method has a great advantage to improve the power of McNemar's test. Among all types of CV methods, a block-regularized 5$\times$2 CV (BCV) has been shown in many previous studies to be superior to the other CV methods in the comparison task of algorithms because the 5$\times$2 BCV can produce a high-quality estimator of the error rate by regularizing the numbers of overlapping records between all training sets. In this study, we compress the 10 correlated contingency tables in the 5$\times$2 BCV to form an effective contingency table. Then, we define a 5$\times$2 BCV McNemar's test on the basis of the effective contingency table. We demonstrate the reasonable type I error and the promising power of the proposed 5$\times$2 BCV McNemar's test on multiple simulated and real-world data sets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) typically have billions of parameters and are thus often difficult to interpret in their operation. Such black-box models can pose a significant risk to safety when trusted to make important decisions. The lack of interpretability of LLMs is more related to their sheer size, rather than the complexity of their individual components. The TARS method for knowledge removal (Davies et al 2024) provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that that linear layer weights which act directly on the residual stream may have high correlation with different concepts encoded in the residual stream. Building upon this, we attempt to decode neuron weights directly into token probabilities through the final projection layer of the model (the LM-head). Firstly, we show that with Llama 3.1 8B we can utilise the LM-head to decode specialised feature neurons that respond strongly to certain concepts, with examples such as "dog" and "California". This is then confirmed by demonstrating that these neurons can be clamped to affect the probability of the concept in the output. This extends to the fine-tuned assistant Llama 3.1 8B instruct model, where we find that over 75% of neurons in the up-projection layers have the same top associated token compared to the pretrained model. Finally, we demonstrate that clamping the "dog" neuron leads the instruct model to always discuss dogs when asked about its favourite animal. Through our method, it is possible to map the entirety of Llama 3.1 8B's up-projection neurons in less than 15 minutes with no parallelization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large scale pretrained language models have demonstrated high performance on standard datasets for natural language inference (NLI) tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations can be misleading, as although the models can perform well on in-distribution data, they perform poorly on out-of-distribution test sets, such as contrast sets. Contrast sets consist of perturbed instances of data that have very minor, but meaningful, changes to the input that alter the gold label, revealing how models can learn superficial patterns in the training data rather than learning more sophisticated language nuances. As an example, the ELECTRA-small language model achieves nearly 90% accuracy on an SNLI dataset but drops to 75% when tested on an out-of-distribution contrast set. The research performed in this study explores how a language models' robustness can be improved by exposing it to small amounts of more complex contrast sets during training to help it better learn language patterns. With this approach, the model regains performance and achieves nearly 90% accuracy on contrast sets, highlighting the importance of diverse and challenging training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate texts that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop of a safe fine-tuned auto-regressive decoder-only LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings demonstrate that instruction fine-tuning on custom datasets tailored for tasks such as debiasing is a highly effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLM while preserving their inherent knowledge and capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Research in the life sciences often employs messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) quantification as a standalone approach for functional analysis. However, although the correlation between the measured levels of mRNA and proteins is positive, correlation coefficients observed empirically are incomplete, necessitating caution in making agnostic inferences. This essay provides a statistical reflection and caveat on the concept of correlation strength in the context of transcriptomics-proteomics studies. It highlights the variability in possible protein levels at given empirical correlation values, even for precise mRNA amount, and underscores the notable proportion of mRNA-protein pairs with abundances at opposite ends of their respective distributions. Cell biologists, data scientists, and biostatisticians should recognise that mRNA-protein correlation alone is insufficient to justify using a single mRNA quantification to infer the amount or function of its corresponding protein.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks. While various defence mechanisms have been proposed, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate these defences across diverse datasets, models, and tasks. In this work, we address this gap by presenting an extensive benchmark for textual adversarial defence that significantly expands upon previous work. Our benchmark incorporates a wide range of datasets, evaluates state-of-the-art defence mechanisms, and extends the assessment to include critical tasks such as single-sentence classification, similarity and paraphrase identification, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. This work not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of adversarial robustness but also identifies key areas for future research in textual adversarial defence. By establishing a new standard for benchmarking in this domain, we aim to accelerate progress towards more robust and reliable natural language processing systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. Toomre claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal mass halo, to be a notable counter-example, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations due to complicated non-linear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise-driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often derived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections and uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a phenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central importance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough will not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed models suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the data. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness and thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an algorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data that finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given dataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling of asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network nodes. Our approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for time-series datasets, where asynchronicty often occurs. We demonstrate our methodology by integrating real data from three datasets, and provide an implementation that can be used by the community for network reconstruction using any high-throughout dataset. Our approach significantly expands the applicability of the Boolean network model to experimental data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising performance in solving complex math problems with a divide-and-conquer pipeline and the assistance of in-context learning (ICL) examples. However, their potential for improvement is limited by two critical problems within their ICL examples: granularity-mismatch and the ensuing negative-effect noise problem. Specifically, the LLMs are capable of the dividing process yet mostly failed by inaccurate reasoning within a few conquer steps, while the ICL examples retrieved in question-grained sometimes lack relevant steps for a specific challenging reasoning step. Further, this disconnect may hinder the correct reasoning due to its irrelevance. To this end, we focus on improving the reasoning quality within each step and present BoostStep. BoostStep aligns the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained, and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy. BoostStep provides more relevant examples than the coarse question-grained strategy, enhancing the model reasoning quality within each step steadily. BoostStep is a general and robust reasoning-enhancing method that not only improves standalone reasoning performance but also integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search methods (MCTS) to refine both candidate generation and decision-making. Quantitatively, it improves GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks, and 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly. Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing. 2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of Generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) raised the alarm regarding identifying content produced through generative AI or humans. In one case, issues arise when students heavily rely on such tools in a manner that can affect the development of their writing or coding skills. Other issues of plagiarism also apply. This study aims to support efforts to detect and identify textual content generated using LLM tools. We hypothesize that LLMs-generated text is detectable by machine learning (ML), and investigate ML models that can recognize and differentiate texts generated by multiple LLMs tools. We leverage several ML and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to understand the important features in attribution. Our method is divided into 1) binary classification to differentiate between human-written and AI-text, and 2) multi classification, to differentiate between human-written text and the text generated by the five different LLM tools (ChatGPT, LLaMA, Google Bard, Claude, and Perplexity). Results show high accuracy in the multi and binary classification. Our model outperformed GPTZero with 98.5\% accuracy to 78.3\%. Notably, GPTZero was unable to recognize about 4.2\% of the observations, but our model was able to recognize the complete test dataset. XAI results showed that understanding feature importance across different classes enables detailed author/source profiles. Further, aiding in attribution and supporting plagiarism detection by highlighting unique stylistic and structural elements ensuring robust content originality verification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study seeks to enhance academic integrity by providing tools to detect AI-generated content in student work using advanced technologies. The findings promote transparency and accountability, helping educators maintain ethical standards and supporting the responsible integration of AI in education. A key contribution of this work is the generation of the CyberHumanAI dataset, which has 1000 observations, 500 of which are written by humans and the other 500 produced by ChatGPT. We evaluate various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms on the CyberHumanAI dataset comparing human-written and AI-generated content from Large Language Models (LLMs) (i.e., ChatGPT). Results demonstrate that traditional ML algorithms, specifically XGBoost and Random Forest, achieve high performance (83% and 81% accuracies respectively). Results also show that classifying shorter content seems to be more challenging than classifying longer content. Further, using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we identify discriminative features influencing the ML model's predictions, where human-written content tends to use a practical language (e.g., use and allow). Meanwhile AI-generated text is characterized by more abstract and formal terms (e.g., realm and employ). Finally, a comparative analysis with GPTZero show that our narrowly focused, simple, and fine-tuned model can outperform generalized systems like GPTZero. The proposed model achieved approximately 77.5% accuracy compared to GPTZero's 48.5% accuracy when tasked to classify Pure AI, Pure Human, and mixed class. GPTZero showed a tendency to classify challenging and small-content cases as either mixed or unrecognized while our proposed model showed a more balanced performance across the three classes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce FACTS Grounding, an online leaderboard and associated benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to generate text that is factually accurate with respect to given context in the user prompt. In our benchmark, each prompt includes a user request and a full document, with a maximum length of 32k tokens, requiring long-form responses. The long-form responses are required to be fully grounded in the provided context document while fulfilling the user request. Models are evaluated using automated judge models in two phases: (1) responses are disqualified if they do not fulfill the user request; (2) they are judged as accurate if the response is fully grounded in the provided document. The automated judge models were comprehensively evaluated against a held-out test-set to pick the best prompt template, and the final factuality score is an aggregate of multiple judge models to mitigate evaluation bias. The FACTS Grounding leaderboard will be actively maintained over time, and contains both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding the integrity of the leaderboard.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale roughly eighteen fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.24} (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.

Previous research has predominantly focused on improving the accuracy and quality of retrieved data chunks to enhance the overall performance of the generation pipeline. However, despite ongoing advancements, the critical issue of retrieving irrelevant information -- which can impair the ability of the model to utilize its internal knowledge effectively -- has received minimal attention. In this work, we investigate the impact of retrieving irrelevant information in open-domain question answering, highlighting its significant detrimental effect on the quality of LLM outputs. To address this challenge, we propose the Context Awareness Gate (CAG) architecture, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts the LLMs' input prompt based on whether the user query necessitates external context retrieval. Additionally, we introduce the Vector Candidates method, a core mathematical component of CAG that is statistical, LLM-independent, and highly scalable. We further examine the distributions of relationships between contexts and questions, presenting a statistical analysis of these distributions. This analysis can be leveraged to enhance the context retrieval process in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [Notice: This version is outdated. Recent research contradicts some key claims; we are working on a major revision with more nuanced analysis. Please wait for the updated version.]   While LLMs excel at multi-hop questions (e.g. "Who is the spouse of the performer of Imagine?") when using chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT), they struggle when forced to reason internally (without CoT). Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations. However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention. This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes. In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task. We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9% to 79.8%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on large-scale pretrained foundation models (PFMs) such as vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), diffusion models and vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated the ability to solve complex and truly non-trivial AI problems in a wide variety of domains and contexts. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scenario-based training has been widely adopted in many public service sectors. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating diverse personas to create these training scenarios. However, little is known about how LLMs can be developed to simulate victims for scenario-based training purposes. In this paper, we introduce VicSim (victim simulator), a novel model that addresses three key dimensions of user simulation: informational faithfulness, emotional dynamics, and language style (e.g., grammar usage). We pioneer the integration of scenario-based victim modeling with GAN-based training workflow and key-information-based prompting, aiming to enhance the realism of simulated victims. Our adversarial training approach teaches the discriminator to recognize grammar and emotional cues as reliable indicators of synthetic content. According to evaluations by human raters, the VicSim model outperforms GPT-4 in terms of human-likeness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in LLMs' "realistic" reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and the creation of high-quality tests that adhere to best practices is essential for effective maintenance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases. However, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a novel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show that LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward models for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a time. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model aimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By comparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated high-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to 21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on four out of seven metrics. This represents a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of software testing through Reinforcement Learning and static quality metrics.

We use 5 different workflow specific experiments and evaluate several open- and closed-source language models using state-of-the-art workflow systems. Our studies reveal that LLMs often struggle with workflow related tasks due to their lack of knowledge of scientific workflows. We further observe that the performance of LLMs varies across experiments and workflow systems. Our findings can help workflow developers and users in understanding LLMs capabilities in scientific workflows, and motivate further research applying LLMs to workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups have become a popular solution for scaling blockchain systems, offering improved transaction throughput and reduced costs by aggregating Layer 2 transactions and submitting them as a single batch to a Layer 1 blockchain. However, the computational burden of generating validity proofs, a key feature of ZK rollups, presents significant challenges in terms of performance and decentralization. Current solutions rely on centralized infrastructure to handle the computational tasks, limiting the scalability and decentralization of rollup systems.   This paper proposes CrowdProve, a prover orchestration layer for outsourcing computation to unreliable commodity hardware run by a broad community of small provers. We apply CrowdProve to proving transaction batches for a popular ZK rollup.   Through our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that community proving can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, existing centralized deployments. Our results show that even systems utilizing modest hardware configurations can match the performance of centralized solutions, making community-based proof generation a viable and cost-effective alternative. CrowdProve allows both the rollup operator and community participants to benefit: the operator reduces infrastructure costs by leveraging idle community hardware, while community provers are compensated for their contributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $<0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software testing is a crucial but time-consuming aspect of software development, and recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity for automated test case generation. However, because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of open-source code, they often generate test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality unit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics. First, we analyzed LLM-generated tests and show that LLMs frequently do generate undesirable test smells -- up to 37% of the time. Then, we implemented lightweight static analysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to optimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test cases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated nearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all code quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model. We provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automated software testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from psychiatric medications are the leading cause of hospitalizations among mental health patients. With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, execution of arbitrary code, and suspicious domain categories as the top detected malicious packages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most existing image tokenizers encode images into a fixed number of tokens or patches, overlooking the inherent variability in image complexity. To address this, we introduce Content-Adaptive Tokenizer (CAT), which dynamically adjusts representation capacity based on the image content and encodes simpler images into fewer tokens. We design a caption-based evaluation system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to predict content complexity and determine the optimal compression ratio for a given image, taking into account factors critical to human perception. Trained on images with diverse compression ratios, CAT demonstrates robust performance in image reconstruction. We also utilize its variable-length latent representations to train Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for ImageNet generation. By optimizing token allocation, CAT improves the FID score over fixed-ratio baselines trained with the same flops and boosts the inference throughput by 18.5%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Imbalanced classification and spurious correlation are common challenges in data science and machine learning. Both issues are linked to data imbalance, with certain groups of data samples significantly underrepresented, which in turn would compromise the accuracy, robustness and generalizability of the learned models. Recent advances have proposed leveraging the flexibility and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically built on transformer architectures, to generate synthetic samples and to augment the observed data. In the context of imbalanced data, LLMs are used to oversample underrepresented groups and have shown promising improvements. However, there is a clear lack of theoretical understanding of such synthetic data approaches. In this article, we develop novel theoretical foundations to systematically study the roles of synthetic samples in addressing imbalanced classification and spurious correlation. Specifically, we first explicitly quantify the benefits of synthetic oversampling. Next, we analyze the scaling dynamics in synthetic data augmentation, and derive the corresponding scaling law. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of transformer models to generate high-quality synthetic samples. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the efficacy of the LLM-based synthetic oversampling and augmentation.

Our method combines two key components: a sub-proof obligation generation phase that breaks down complex proof obligations into simpler sub-obligations, and a proof generation phase that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation with verified proof examples. We evaluate our approach using proof obligations from varying complexity levels of proof obligations, spanning from fundamental arithmetic properties to the properties of algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that while the method successfully generates valid proofs for intermediate-complexity obligations, it faces limitations with more complex theorems. These results indicate that our approach can effectively assist in proof development for certain classes of properties, contributing to the broader goal of integrating LLMs into formal verification workflows.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been gaining a lot of interest due to their adaptability and extensibility in emerging applications, including communication networks. It is anticipated that ZSM networks will be able to support LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency communications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are vulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of LLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the security vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in ZSM networks, in particular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an attack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker has access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the membership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can lead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental results show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on named entity recognition task. Based on the experimental analysis, we discuss possible defense mechanisms and present possible research directions to make the LLMs more trustworthy in the context of ZSM networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) world, manufacturers or integrators must be aware of the security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications. To provide tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications (for the European context) is very useful. We here address the development of this ontology. Due to the very high number and size of the considered specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology. The first step is a manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual translation to XML/XSD is operated. We have developed a tool allowing us to convert this semi-structured data into an ontology. Because the different specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the creation of similar instances in the ontology. To improve the ontology simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs. The responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct responses. The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting point for a manual correction.

The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t.~data samples, or (ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several SGD updates, and we show that it converges to an SPS solution with reduced bias. Numerical experiments corroborate our theories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose a new approach to building a artificial general intelligence with self awareness, which includes: (1) a new method to implement attention mechanisms; (2) a way to give machines self-demands; (3) how to form a value evaluation system compatible with the network; (4) a way to create the world models; (5) how to realize a top-down, hierarchical thinking decision-making chain; (6) a way to achieve general decision-making and response capabilities; (7) a way for a machine to directly obtain human experience through language. In the paper, we first analyze some of the shortcomings of current LLMs (Large Language Model) and propose ideas for improvement. Then we analyze why our scheme can solve the above problems and provide detailed steps for implementing our scheme. In chapter 4, we have presented a step-by-step mplementation roadmap. And in chapter 5, we have presented a specific implementation demonstration. In chapter 6, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of our scheme and propose further research directions. In this article, we have put forward how to create genuine artificial general intelligence step by step. It can handle data of all modalities in a unified form and can directly understand the experience that humans already possess through language, thus avoiding the problem that reinforcement learning is required for every decision-making process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, yet they still face significant challenges in reasoning and arithmetic. Temporal reasoning, a critical component of natural language understanding, has raised increasing research attention. However, comprehensive testing of Allen's interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) -- a fundamental framework for temporal relationships -- remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, focusing on identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic, using both abstract events and real-world data from Wikidata. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs using this benchmark and the results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs and ChronoSense offers a robust framework for future research in this area. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense.

In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. We introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework that qualitatively assesses specific capability dimensions and conduct quantitative analyses on the step-by-step outputs of various quantization methods. Our results demonstrate that quantization differentially affects numerical computation and reasoning planning abilities, identifying key areas where quantized models experience performance degradation.

Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal LLMs have reached remarkable levels of proficiency in understanding multimodal inputs, driving extensive research to develop increasingly powerful models. However, much less attention has been paid to understanding and explaining the underlying mechanisms of these models. Most existing explainability research examines these models only in their final states, overlooking the dynamic representational shifts that occur during training. In this work, we systematically analyze the evolution of hidden state representations to reveal how fine-tuning alters the internal structure of a model to specialize in new multimodal tasks. Using a concept-based approach, we map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts, enabling us to trace changes in encoded concepts across modalities as training progresses. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by shifting those in the original model. Finally, we explore the practical impact of our findings on model steering, showing that we can adjust multimodal LLMs behaviors without any training, such as modifying answer types, captions style, or biasing the model toward specific responses. Our work sheds light on how multimodal representations evolve through fine-tuning and offers a new perspective for interpreting model adaptation in multimodal tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial and challenging task. In this study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their parameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a black-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover input-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe behaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM responds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative response from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This black-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points, the discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address these challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to finetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased input-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory completions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific names under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for auditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables arbitrary translations across multiple languages by training a model with limited parameters using parallel data only. However, the performance of such MNMT models still lags behind that of large language models (LLMs), limiting their practicality. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing registering to achieve the new state-of-the-art of decoder-only MNMT models. Specifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target language, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and target tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation only pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source tokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale benchmark, show that our method outperforms related methods driven by optimizing multilingual representations. We further scale up and collect 9.3 billion sentence pairs across 24 languages from public datasets to pre-train two models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers). One of them, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with commercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we open-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT: https://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input. When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses. RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains. While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG. However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks. Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction. In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG. Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based. By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack. Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%. It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes. Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, vision language models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in video understanding. However, a crucial capability - fine-grained motion comprehension - remains under-explored in current benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose MotionBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained motion comprehension of video understanding models. MotionBench evaluates models' motion-level perception through six primary categories of motion-oriented question types and includes data collected from diverse sources, ensuring a broad representation of real-world video content. Experimental results reveal that existing VLMs perform poorly in understanding fine-grained motions. To enhance VLM's ability to perceive fine-grained motion within a limited sequence length of LLM, we conduct extensive experiments reviewing VLM architectures optimized for video feature compression and propose a novel and efficient Through-Encoder (TE) Fusion method. Experiments show that higher frame rate inputs and TE Fusion yield improvements in motion understanding, yet there is still substantial room for enhancement. Our benchmark aims to guide and motivate the development of more capable video understanding models, emphasizing the importance of fine-grained motion comprehension.

To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unprecedented agility and dexterous manipulation have been demonstrated with controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), with a significant impact on legged and humanoid robots. Modern tooling and simulation platforms, such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances. This article focuses on demonstrating the applications of Isaac in local planning and obstacle avoidance as one of the most fundamental ways in which a mobile robot interacts with its environments. Although there is extensive research on proprioception-based RL policies, the article highlights less standardized and reproducible approaches to exteroception. At the same time, the article aims to provide a base framework for end-to-end local navigation policies and how a custom robot can be trained in such simulation environment. We benchmark end-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot Operating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by demonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac simulator to real-world robots. This is further evidenced by the tests with different simulated robots, which show the generalization of the learned policy. Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2, opening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local planners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the possibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for more complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most important steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local path planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing, and ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (Video-LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding videos. However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) has transformative potential in various domains, including recommender systems (RS). There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. However, previous efforts mainly focus on LLM as RS, which may face the challenge of intolerant inference costs by LLM. Recently, the integration of LLM into RS, known as LLM-Enhanced Recommender Systems (LLMERS), has garnered significant interest due to its potential to address latency and memory constraints in real-world applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest research efforts aimed at leveraging LLM to enhance RS capabilities. We identify a critical shift in the field with the move towards incorporating LLM into the online system, notably by avoiding their use during inference. Our survey categorizes the existing LLMERS approaches into three primary types based on the component of the RS model being augmented: Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement, and Model Enhancement. We provide an in-depth analysis of each category, discussing the methodologies, challenges, and contributions of recent studies. Furthermore, we highlight several promising research directions that could further advance the field of LLMERS.

To address these issues, we introduce a medical instruction dataset, CMedINS, containing six medical instructions derived from actual medical tasks, which effectively fine-tunes LLM in conjunction with other data. Subsequently, We launch our medical model, IIMedGPT, employing an efficient preference alignment method, Direct preference Optimization(DPO). The results show that our final model outperforms existing medical models in medical dialogue.Datsets, Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, pivotal to various applications such as query optimization, data integration, and schema matching. While neural network-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on abundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less effective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is scarce, and target labels frequently evolve based on application needs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their extensive pretraining and contextual understanding. Current approaches provide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side information (e.g., descriptions) to predict text labels. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced through side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for dynamic few-shot text classification. GORAG constructs and maintains an adaptive information graph by extracting side information across all target texts, rather than treating each input independently. It employs a weighted edge mechanism to prioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and dynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree tailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG outperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and accurate contextual information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an effective technology used for information detection by detecting Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). The current RSVP decoding methods can perform well in decoding EEG signals within a single RSVP task, but their decoding performance significantly decreases when directly applied to different RSVP tasks without calibration data from the new tasks. This limits the rapid and efficient deployment of RSVP-BCI systems for detecting different categories of targets in various scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this study aims to enhance the cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding performance. First, we design three distinct RSVP tasks for target image retrieval and build an open-source dataset containing EEG signals and corresponding stimulus images. Then we propose an EEG with Language-Image Prior fusion Transformer (ELIPformer) for cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding. Specifically, we propose a prompt encoder based on the language-image pre-trained model to extract language-image features from task-specific prompts and stimulus images as prior knowledge for enhancing EEG decoding. A cross bidirectional attention mechanism is also adopted to facilitate the effective feature fusion and alignment between the EEG and language-image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in cross-task zero-calibration RSVP decoding, which promotes the RSVP-BCI system from research to practical application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Can LLMs pick up language structure from examples? Evidence in prior work seems to indicate yes, as pretrained models repeatedly demonstrate the ability to adapt to new language structures and vocabularies. However, this line of research typically considers languages that are present within common pretraining datasets, or otherwise share notable similarities with these seen languages. In contrast, in this work we attempt to measure models' language understanding capacity while circumventing the risk of dataset recall. We parameterize large families of language tasks recognized by deterministic finite automata (DFAs), and can thus sample novel language reasoning problems to fairly evaulate LLMs regardless of training data. We find that, even in the strikingly simple setting of 3-state DFAs, LLMs underperform unparameterized ngram models on both language recognition and synthesis tasks. These results suggest that LLMs struggle to match the ability of basic language models in recognizing and reasoning over languages that are sufficiently distinct from the ones they see at training time, underscoring the distinction between learning individual languages and possessing a general theory of language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT4o, have shown strong capabilities in visual reasoning and explanation generation. However, despite these strengths, they face significant challenges in the increasingly critical task of Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL). Moreover, existing IFDL methods are typically limited to the learning of low-level semantic-agnostic clues and merely provide a single outcome judgment. To tackle these issues, we propose ForgeryGPT, a novel framework that advances the IFDL task by capturing high-order forensics knowledge correlations of forged images from diverse linguistic feature spaces, while enabling explainable generation and interactive dialogue through a newly customized Large Language Model (LLM) architecture. Specifically, ForgeryGPT enhances traditional LLMs by integrating the Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor, which enables the excavating of precise forgery mask information from input images and facilitating pixel-level understanding of tampering artifacts. The Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor consists of a Forgery Localization Expert (FL-Expert) and a Mask Encoder, where the FL-Expert is augmented with an Object-agnostic Forgery Prompt and a Vocabulary-enhanced Vision Encoder, allowing for effectively capturing of multi-scale fine-grained forgery details. To enhance its performance, we implement a three-stage training strategy, supported by our designed Mask-Text Alignment and IFDL Task-Specific Instruction Tuning datasets, which align vision-language modalities and improve forgery detection and instruction-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs. Benchmarking results on 16 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, widespread sensor deployment has become essential. However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multilingual proficiency presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). English-centric models are usually suboptimal in other languages, particularly those that are linguistically distant from English. This performance discrepancy mainly stems from the imbalanced distribution of training data across languages during pre-training and instruction tuning stages. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach called CrossIn, which utilizes a mixed composition of cross-lingual instruction tuning data. Our method leverages the compressed representation shared by various languages to efficiently enhance the model's task-solving capabilities and multilingual proficiency within a single process. In addition, we introduce a multi-task and multi-faceted benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of CrossIn. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves performance across tasks and languages, and we provide extensive insights into the impact of cross-lingual data volume and the integration of translation data on enhancing multilingual consistency and accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of a multidisciplinary approach to testing and aligning artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid development and wide application of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment, controllability, and predictability of these models emerged as global risks. This study investigates an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital citizens,' simulating complex social structures and interactions to examine and optimize AI. Application of various theories from the fields of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible AI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social dynamics. This research endeavors to contribute to the development and refinement of AI, emphasizing the integration of social, ethical, and theoretical dimensions for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various reasoning tasks, yet building a single model that consistently excels across all domains remains challenging. This paper addresses this problem by exploring strategies to integrate multiple domain-specialized models into an efficient pivot model.We propose two fusion strategies to combine the strengths of multiple LLMs: (1) a pairwise, multi-step fusion approach that sequentially distills each source model into the pivot model, followed by a weight merging step to integrate the distilled models into the final model. This method achieves strong performance but requires substantial training effort; and (2) a unified fusion approach that aggregates all source models' outputs simultaneously.To improve the fusion process, we introduce a novel Rate-Skewness Adaptive Fusion (RSAF) technique, which dynamically adjusts top-K ratios during parameter merging for enhanced flexibility and stability.Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-based weighting method for the unified approach, which dynamically balances the contributions of source models and outperforms other logits/distribution ensemble methods.We achieved accuracy improvements of 9.27%, 8.80%, and 8.89% on the GSM8K, MATH, and HumanEval tasks, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Assessment and evaluation have long been critical challenges in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks (i.e., non-terrestrial network (NTN)), such as Starlink, have been successfully deployed to provide broader coverage than terrestrial networks (TN). Due to limited spectrum resources, TN and NTN may soon share the same spectrum. Therefore, fine-grained spectrum monitoring is crucial for spectrum sharing and interference avoidance. To this end, constructing a 4D radio map (RM) including three spatial dimensions and signal spectra is important. However, this requires the large deployment of sensors, and high-speed analog-to-digital converters for extensive spatial signal collection and wide power spectrum acquisition, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a deep unsupervised learning framework without ground truths labeling requirement, DeepRM, comprised of neural compressive sensing (CS) and tensor decomposition (TD) algorithms. Firstly, we map the CS process into the optimization of a neural networksassociated loss function, and design a sparsity-performance balance training algorithm to reconstruct a wide power spectrum under limited sub-Nquist samples. Secondly, according to the output of neural CS algorithm, we also utilize neural networks to perform TD, and construct the 3D RM for each frequency, even under very sparse sensor deployment. Extensive evaluations show that DeepRM achieves lower error than its corresponding state-of-the-art baselines, especially with limited samples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective channel estimation in sparse and high-dimensional environments is essential for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in large-scale MIMO deployments. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the dramatic upsurge in the volume of ultrasound examinations, low-quality ultrasound imaging has gradually increased due to variations in operator proficiency and imaging circumstances, imposing a severe burden on diagnosis accuracy and even entailing the risk of restarting the diagnosis in critical cases. To assist clinicians in selecting high-quality ultrasound images and ensuring accurate diagnoses, we introduce Ultrasound-QBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on quality assessment tasks of ultrasound images. Ultrasound-QBench establishes two datasets collected from diverse sources: IVUSQA, consisting of 7,709 images, and CardiacUltraQA, containing 3,863 images. These images encompassing common ultrasound imaging artifacts are annotated by professional ultrasound experts and classified into three quality levels: high, medium, and low. To better evaluate MLLMs, we decompose the quality assessment task into three dimensionalities: qualitative classification, quantitative scoring, and comparative assessment. The evaluation of 7 open-source MLLMs as well as 1 proprietary MLLMs demonstrates that MLLMs possess preliminary capabilities for low-level visual tasks in ultrasound image quality classification. We hope this benchmark will inspire the research community to delve deeper into uncovering and enhancing the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical imaging tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has led to substantial performance improvements. However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness to noisy and out-of-distribution data. These techniques expose the model to a broader range of patterns, improving its adaptability in generating recommendations with varying levels of diversity. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that DLCRec not only provides precise control over diversity but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Previous fake speech datasets were constructed from a defender's perspective to develop countermeasure (CM) systems without considering diverse motivations of attackers. To better align with real-life scenarios, we created LlamaPartialSpoof, a 130-hour dataset that contains both fully and partially fake speech, using a large language model (LLM) and voice cloning technologies to evaluate the robustness of CMs. By examining valuable information for both attackers and defenders, we identify several key vulnerabilities in current CM systems, which can be exploited to enhance attack success rates, including biases toward certain text-to-speech models or concatenation methods. Our experimental results indicate that the current fake speech detection system struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, achieving a best performance of 24.49% equal error rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text augmentation (TA) is a critical technique for text classification, especially in few-shot settings. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based TA method, TARDiS, to address challenges inherent in the generation and alignment stages of two-stage TA methods. For the generation stage, we propose two generation processes, SEG and CEG, incorporating multiple class-specific prompts to enhance diversity and separability. For the alignment stage, we introduce a class adaptation (CA) method to ensure that generated examples align with their target classes through verification and modification. Experimental results demonstrate TARDiS's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based TA methods in various few-shot text classification tasks. An in-depth analysis confirms the detailed behaviors at each stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is a promising paradigm for next-generation communication systems, particularly in challenging transmission environments. In this paper, we propose a novel standard-compatible JSCC framework for the transmission of images over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Different from the existing end-to-end AI-based DeepJSCC schemes, our framework consists of learnable modules that enable communication using conventional separate source and channel codes (SSCC), which makes it amenable for easy deployment on legacy systems. Specifically, the learnable modules involve a preprocessing-empowered network (PPEN) for preserving essential semantic information, and a precoder \& combiner-enhanced network (PCEN) for efficient transmission over a resource-constrained MIMO channel. We treat existing compression and channel coding modules as non-trainable blocks. Since the parameters of these modules are non-differentiable, we employ a proxy network that mimics their operations when training the learnable modules. Numerical results demonstrate that our scheme can save more than 29\% of the channel bandwidth, and requires lower complexity compared to the constrained baselines. We also show its generalization capability to unseen datasets and tasks through extensive experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The structural properties of naturally arising social graphs are extensively studied to understand their evolution. Prior approaches for modeling network dynamics typically rely on rule-based models, which lack realism and generalizability, or deep learning-based models, which require large-scale training datasets. Social graphs, as abstract graph representations of entity-wise interactions, present an opportunity to explore network evolution mechanisms through realistic simulations of human-item interactions. Leveraging the pre-trained social consensus knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs), we present GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic, text-attributed social graph generation. GAG simulates the temporal node and edge generation processes for zero-shot social graph generation. The resulting graphs exhibit adherence to seven key macroscopic network properties, achieving an 11% improvement in microscopic graph structure metrics. Through the node classification benchmarking task, we validate GAG effectively captures the intricate text-structure correlations in graph generation. Furthermore, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation with parallel acceleration, achieving a minimum speed-up of 90.4%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding. However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness. Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various tasks, including knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, current studies mostly apply LLMs to classification tasks, like identifying missing triplets, rather than ranking-based tasks, where the model ranks candidate entities based on plausibility. This focus limits the practical use of LLMs in KGC, as real-world applications prioritize highly plausible triplets. Additionally, while graph paths can help infer the existence of missing triplets and improve completion accuracy, they often contain redundant information. To address these issues, we propose KG-CF, a framework tailored for ranking-based KGC tasks. KG-CF leverages LLMs' reasoning abilities to filter out irrelevant contexts, achieving superior results on real-world datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks by understanding input information and predicting corresponding outputs. However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although large models have shown a strong capacity to solve large-scale problems in many areas including natural language and computer vision, their voluminous parameters are hard to deploy in a real-time system due to computational and energy constraints. Addressing this, knowledge distillation through Teacher-Student architecture offers a sustainable pathway to compress the knowledge of large models into more manageable sizes without significantly compromising performance. To enhance the robustness and interpretability of this framework, it is critical to understand how individual training data impact model performance, which is an area that remains underexplored. We propose the \textbf{Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Influence Weight (KD-AIF)} framework which leverages influence functions from robust statistics to assign weights to training data, grounded in the four key SAFE principles: Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, and Explainability. This novel approach not only optimizes distillation but also increases transparency by revealing the significance of different data. The exploration of various update mechanisms within the KD-AIF framework further elucidates its potential to significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization in student models, marking a step toward more explainable and deployable Large Models. KD-AIF is effective in knowledge distillation while also showing exceptional performance in semi-supervised learning with outperforms existing baselines and methods in multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-4k, SVHN-1k, and GLUE).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a novel architecture for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to improve Question Answering (QA) tasks from a target corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the analyzing and generation of human-like text. These models rely on pre-trained data and lack real-time updates unless integrated with live data tools. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating online resources and databases to generate contextually appropriate responses. However, traditional RAG still encounters challenges like information dilution and hallucinations when handling vast amounts of data. Our approach addresses these challenges by converting corpora into a domain-specific dataset and RAG architecture is constructed to generate responses from the target document. We introduce QuIM-RAG (Question-to-question Inverted Index Matching), a novel approach for the retrieval mechanism in our system. This strategy generates potential questions from document chunks and matches these with user queries to identify the most relevant text chunks for generating accurate answers. We have implemented our RAG system on top of the open-source Meta-LLaMA3-8B-instruct model by Meta Inc. that is available on Hugging Face. We constructed a custom corpus of 500+ pages from a high-traffic website accessed thousands of times daily for answering complex questions, along with manually prepared ground truth QA for evaluation. We compared our approach with traditional RAG models using BERT-Score and RAGAS, state-of-the-art metrics for evaluating LLM applications. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional RAG architectures on both metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models and vision transformers have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities, enabling significant transferability in downstream tasks. The fusion of these models has resulted in multi-modal architectures with enhanced instructional capabilities. Despite incorporating vast image and language pre-training, these multi-modal architectures often generate responses that deviate from the ground truth in the image data. These failure cases are known as hallucinations. Current methods for mitigating hallucinations generally focus on regularizing the language component, improving the fusion module, or ensembling multiple visual encoders to improve visual representation. In this paper, we address the hallucination issue by directly enhancing the capabilities of the visual component. Our approach, named EAGLE, is fully agnostic to the LLM or fusion module and works as a post-pretraining approach that improves the grounding and language alignment of the visual encoder. We show that a straightforward reformulation of the original contrastive pre-training task results in an improved visual encoder that can be incorporated into the instructional multi-modal architecture without additional instructional training. As a result, EAGLE achieves a significant reduction in hallucinations across multiple challenging benchmarks and tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) typically have billions of parameters and are thus often difficult to interpret in their operation. Such black-box models can pose a significant risk to safety when trusted to make important decisions. The lack of interpretability of LLMs is more related to their sheer size, rather than the complexity of their individual components. The TARS method for knowledge removal (Davies et al 2024) provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that that linear layer weights which act directly on the residual stream may have high correlation with different concepts encoded in the residual stream. Building upon this, we attempt to decode neuron weights directly into token probabilities through the final projection layer of the model (the LM-head). Firstly, we show that with Llama 3.1 8B we can utilise the LM-head to decode specialised feature neurons that respond strongly to certain concepts, with examples such as "dog" and "California". This is then confirmed by demonstrating that these neurons can be clamped to affect the probability of the concept in the output. This extends to the fine-tuned assistant Llama 3.1 8B instruct model, where we find that over 75% of neurons in the up-projection layers have the same top associated token compared to the pretrained model. Finally, we demonstrate that clamping the "dog" neuron leads the instruct model to always discuss dogs when asked about its favourite animal. Through our method, it is possible to map the entirety of Llama 3.1 8B's up-projection neurons in less than 15 minutes with no parallelization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and translation, among others. However, these models often generate texts that can perpetuate biases. Existing approaches to mitigate these biases usually compromise knowledge retention. This study explores whether LLMs can produce safe, unbiased outputs without sacrificing knowledge or comprehension. We introduce the Safe and Responsible Large Language Model (\textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$), which has been instruction fine-tuned atop of a safe fine-tuned auto-regressive decoder-only LLM to reduce biases in generated texts. We developed a specialized dataset with examples of unsafe and corresponding safe variations to train \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ to identify and correct biased text. Experiments on our specialized dataset and out-of-distribution test sets reveal that \textbf{SR}$_{\text{LLM}}$ effectively reduces biases while preserving knowledge integrity. This performance surpasses that of traditional fine-tuning of smaller language models and base LLMs that merely reply on prompting techniques. Our findings demonstrate that instruction fine-tuning on custom datasets tailored for tasks such as debiasing is a highly effective strategy for minimizing bias in LLM while preserving their inherent knowledge and capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel method for open-vocabulary 3D scene querying in autonomous driving by combining Language Embedded 3D Gaussians with Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.

However, jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to elicit unintended or harmful outputs, threaten LLMs' safety significantly. In this paper, we introduce Layer-AdvPatcher, a novel methodology designed to defend against jailbreak attacks by utilizing an unlearning strategy to patch specific layers within LLMs through self-augmented datasets. Our insight is that certain layer(s), tend to produce affirmative tokens when faced with harmful prompts. By identifying these layers and adversarially exposing them to generate more harmful data, one can understand their inherent and diverse vulnerabilities to attacks. With these exposures, we then "unlearn" these issues, reducing the impact of affirmative tokens and hence minimizing jailbreak risks while keeping the model's responses to safe queries intact. We conduct extensive experiments on two models, four benchmark datasets, and multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak benchmarks to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Results indicate that our framework reduces the harmfulness and attack success rate of jailbreak attacks without compromising utility for benign queries compared to recent defense methods.

  Pre-Training Datasets</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A critical part of creating code suggestion systems is the pre-training of Large Language Models on vast amounts of source code and natural language text, often of questionable origin or quality. This may contribute to the presence of bugs and vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs. While efforts to identify bugs at or after code generation exist, it is preferable to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs on curated, high-quality, and compliant datasets. The need for vast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated, minimizing human intervention.   We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data. This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities. We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs. The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs. Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use. Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations. We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantized training of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open challenge, as maintaining accuracy while performing all matrix multiplications in low precision has proven difficult. This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which often already have large weight and activation outlier values that render quantized optimization difficult. We present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, to mitigate outliers during the low-precision computation, 2) FSDP integration for low-precision communication, and 3) high-performance kernel support. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.31x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. Our method supports both standard and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, both backed by efficient kernel implementations. Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in FP8 precision, while delivering performance benefits.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rising demand for generative large language models (LLMs) poses challenges for thermal and power management in cloud datacenters. Traditional techniques often are inadequate for LLM inference due to the fine-grained, millisecond-scale execution phases, each with distinct performance, thermal, and power profiles. Additionally, LLM inference workloads are sensitive to various configuration parameters (e.g., model parallelism, size, and quantization) that involve trade-offs between performance, temperature, power, and output quality. Moreover, clouds often co-locate SaaS and IaaS workloads, each with different levels of visibility and flexibility. We propose TAPAS, a thermal- and power-aware framework designed for LLM inference clusters in the cloud. TAPAS enhances cooling and power oversubscription capabilities, reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) while effectively handling emergencies (e.g., cooling and power failures). The system leverages historical temperature and power data, along with the adaptability of SaaS workloads, to: (1) efficiently place new GPU workload VMs within cooling and power constraints, (2) route LLM inference requests across SaaS VMs, and (3) reconfigure SaaS VMs to manage load spikes and emergency situations. Our evaluation on a large GPU cluster demonstrates significant reductions in thermal and power throttling events, boosting system efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with direct-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The machine learning and data science community has made significant while dispersive progress in accelerating transformer-based large language models (LLMs), and one promising approach is to replace the original causal attention in a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) with \emph{exponentially decaying causal linear attention}. In this paper, we present LeetDecoding, which is the first Python package that provides a large set of computation routines for this fundamental operator. The launch of LeetDecoding was motivated by the current lack of (1) clear understanding of the complexity regarding this operator, (2) a comprehensive collection of existing computation methods (usually spread in seemingly unrelated fields), and (3) CUDA implementations for fast inference on GPU. LeetDecoding's design is easy to integrate with existing linear-attention LLMs, and allows for researchers to benchmark and evaluate new computation methods for exponentially decaying causal linear attention. The usage of LeetDecoding does not require any knowledge of GPU programming and the underlying complexity analysis, intentionally making LeetDecoding accessible to LLM practitioners. The source code of LeetDecoding is provided at \href{https://github.com/Computational-Machine-Intelligence/LeetDecoding}{this GitHub repository}, and users can simply install LeetDecoding by the command \texttt{pip install leet-decoding}.

Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimization modeling plays a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate such task. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling and developing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce OR-Instruct, a semi-automated data synthesis framework for optimization modeling that enables customizable enhancements for specific scenarios or model types. We also introduce IndustryOR, the first industrial benchmark for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. We train several 7B-scale open-source LLMs using synthesized data (dubbed ORLMs{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}), which exhibit significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Additionally, our experiments highlight the potential of scaling law and reinforcement learning to further enhance the performance of ORLMs. The workflows and human-machine interaction paradigms of ORLMs in practical industrial applications are also discussed in the paper.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific figure captioning is a complex task that requires generating contextually appropriate descriptions of visual content. However, existing methods often fall short by utilizing incomplete information, treating the task solely as either an image-to-text or text summarization problem. This limitation hinders the generation of high-quality captions that fully capture the necessary details. Moreover, existing data sourced from arXiv papers contain low-quality captions, posing significant challenges for training large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a framework called Multi-LLM Collaborative Figure Caption Generation (MLBCAP) to address these challenges by leveraging specialized LLMs for distinct sub-tasks. Our approach unfolds in three key modules: (Quality Assessment) We utilize multimodal LLMs to assess the quality of training data, enabling the filtration of low-quality captions. (Diverse Caption Generation) We then employ a strategy of fine-tuning/prompting multiple LLMs on the captioning task to generate candidate captions. (Judgment) Lastly, we prompt a prominent LLM to select the highest quality caption from the candidates, followed by refining any remaining inaccuracies. Human evaluations demonstrate that informative captions produced by our approach rank better than human-written captions, highlighting its effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of rapid digital communication, vast amounts of textual data are generated daily, demanding efficient methods for latent content analysis to extract meaningful insights. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for automating this process, yet comprehensive assessments comparing their performance to human annotators across multiple dimensions are lacking. This study evaluates the reliability, consistency, and quality of seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including variants of OpenAI's GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and Mixtral, relative to human annotators in analyzing sentiment, political leaning, emotional intensity, and sarcasm detection. A total of 33 human annotators and eight LLM variants assessed 100 curated textual items, generating 3,300 human and 19,200 LLM annotations, with LLMs evaluated across three time points to examine temporal consistency. Inter-rater reliability was measured using Krippendorff's alpha, and intra-class correlation coefficients assessed consistency over time. The results reveal that both humans and LLMs exhibit high reliability in sentiment analysis and political leaning assessments, with LLMs demonstrating higher internal consistency than humans. In emotional intensity, LLMs displayed higher agreement compared to humans, though humans rated emotional intensity significantly higher. Both groups struggled with sarcasm detection, evidenced by low agreement. LLMs showed excellent temporal consistency across all dimensions, indicating stable performance over time. This research concludes that LLMs, especially GPT-4, can effectively replicate human analysis in sentiment and political leaning, although human expertise remains essential for emotional intensity interpretation. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for consistent and high-quality performance in certain areas of latent content analysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the expansion of neural networks, such as large language models, humanity is exponentially heading towards superintelligence. As various AI systems are increasingly integrated into the fabric of societies-through recommending values, devising creative solutions, and making decisions-it becomes critical to assess how these AI systems impact humans in the long run. This research aims to contribute towards establishing a benchmark for evaluating the sentiment of various Large Language Models in socially importan issues. The methodology adopted was a Likert scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared against sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results highlighted a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment score towards AGI, whereas Bard was leaning towards the neutral sentiment. The human samples, contrastingly, showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The temporal comparison revealed differences in sentiment evolution between LLMs in three days, ranging from 1.03% to 8.21%. The study's analysis outlines the prospect of potential conflicts of interest and bias possibilities in LLMs' sentiment formation. Results indicate that LLMs, akin to human cognitive processes, could potentially develop unique sentiments and subtly influence societies' perceptions towards various opinions formed within the LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision generation remains a challenging frontier in artificial intelligence, requiring seamless integration of visual understanding and generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Vision-Driven Prompt Optimization (VDPO), that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically generate textual prompts from visual inputs, guiding high-fidelity image synthesis. VDPO combines a visual embedding prompt tuner, a textual instruction generator, and a vision generation module to achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse vision generation tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as COCO and Sketchy demonstrate that VDPO consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in FID, LPIPS, and BLEU/CIDEr scores. Additional analyses reveal the scalability, robustness, and generalization capabilities of VDPO, making it a versatile solution for in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Human evaluations further validate the practical superiority of VDPO in generating visually appealing and semantically coherent outputs.

However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces sTiles, a GPU-accelerated framework for factorizing sparse structured symmetric matrices. By leveraging tile algorithms for fine-grained computations, sTiles uses a structure-aware task execution flow to handle challenging arrowhead sparse matrices with variable bandwidths, common in scientific and engineering fields. It minimizes fill-in during Cholesky factorization using permutation techniques and employs a static scheduler to manage tasks on shared-memory systems with GPU accelerators. sTiles balances tile size and parallelism, where larger tiles enhance algorithmic intensity but increase floating-point operations and memory usage, while parallelism is constrained by the arrowhead structure. To expose more parallelism, a left-looking Cholesky variant breaks sequential dependencies in trailing submatrix updates via tree reductions. Evaluations show sTiles achieves speedups of up to 8.41X, 9.34X, 5.07X, and 11.08X compared to CHOLMOD, SymPACK, MUMPS, and PARDISO, respectively, and a 5X speedup compared to a 32-core AMD EPYC CPU on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Our generic software framework imports well-established concepts from dense matrix computations but they all require customizations in their deployments on hybrid architectures to best handle factorizations of sparse matrices with arrowhead structures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> News Articles provides crucial information about various events happening in the society but they unfortunately come with different kind of biases. These biases can significantly distort public opinion and trust in the media, making it essential to develop techniques to detect and address them. Previous works have majorly worked towards identifying biases in particular domains e.g., Political, gender biases. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to detect biases across diverse domains. Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful way to analyze and understand natural language, making them ideal for constructing datasets and detecting these biases. In this work, we have explored various biases present in the news articles, built a dataset using LLMs and present results obtained using multiple detection techniques. Our approach highlights the importance of broad-spectrum bias detection and offers new insights for improving the integrity of news articles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Breast cancer histopathology image classification is critical for early detection and improved patient outcomes. 1 This study introduces a novel approach leveraging EfficientNetV2 models, to improve feature extraction and focus on relevant tissue regions. The proposed models were evaluated on the BreakHis dataset across multiple magnification scales (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). 2 Among them, the EfficientNetV2-XL with CBAM achieved outstanding performance, reaching a peak accuracy of 98.96 percent and an F1-score of 98.31 percent at 400X magnification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. 3 By integrating Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for preprocessing and optimizing computational efficiency, this method demonstrates its suitability for real-time clinical deployment. 3 The results underscore the potential of attention-enhanced scalable architectures in advancing diagnostic precision for breast cancer detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the information era, how learners find, evaluate, and effectively use information has become a challenging issue, especially with the added complexity of large language models (LLMs) that have further confused learners in their information retrieval and search activities. This study attempts to unpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the theories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory learning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's learning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops, aiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development in students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs integrated into information retrieval and information theory can support students in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting student-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new era with LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) primarily trained on English texts, often face biases and inaccuracies in Chinese contexts. Their limitations are pronounced in fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), where cultural and clinical subtleties are vital, further hindered by a lack of domain-specific data, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To address these issues, this paper introduces Hengqin-RA-v1, the first large language model specifically tailored for TCM with a focus on diagnosing and treating RA. We also present HQ-GCM-RA-C1, a comprehensive RA-specific dataset curated from ancient Chinese medical literature, classical texts, and modern clinical studies. This dataset empowers Hengqin-RA-v1 to deliver accurate and culturally informed responses, effectively bridging the gaps left by general-purpose models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hengqin-RA-v1 outperforms state-of-the-art models, even surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of TCM practitioners in certain cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.
