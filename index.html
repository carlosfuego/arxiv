                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores. Alongside unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We perform initial measurements that provide practical insight into CXL0. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. These transformations enhance linearizable algorithms with durability under a general partial-failure model. We provide an additional transformation for algorithms designed for persistent main memory and full-system crashes. We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and modeling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To support the growing demand for data-intensive and low-latency IoT applications, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as an effective edge-computing approach enabling the execution of delay-sensitive processing tasks close to end-users. However, most of the existing works on resource allocation and service placement in MEC systems overlook the unique characteristics of new IoT use cases. For instance, many IoT applications require the periodic execution of computing tasks on real-time data streams that originate from devices dispersed over a wide area. Thus, users requesting IoT services are typically distant from the data producers. To fill this gap, the contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a MEC-compliant architectural solution to support the operation of multiple IoT service providers over a common MEC platform deployment, which enables the steering and shaping of IoT data transport within the platform. Secondly, we model the problem of service placement and data management in the proposed MEC-based solution taking into account the dependencies at the data level between IoT services and sensing resources. Our model also considers that caches can be deployed on MEC hosts, to allow the sharing of the same data between different IoT services with overlapping geographical scope, and provides support for IoT services with heterogeneous QoS requirements, such as different frequencies of periodic task execution. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed using linear relaxation and rounding techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, especially when traffic demands generated by the service requests are not uniform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks enable large-scale data collection by leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices. However, frequent sensing and data transmission can lead to significant resource consumption. To mitigate this issue, edge caching has been proposed as a solution for storing recently collected data. Nonetheless, this approach may compromise data freshness. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in cache-enabled MCS networks, aiming to minimize system latency while maintaining information freshness. To this end, we formulate a weighted delay and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, jointly optimizing sensing decisions, user selection, channel selection, task allocation, and caching strategies. The problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem which is intractable. Therefore, we decompose the long-term problem into sequential one-shot sub-problems and design a framework that optimizes system latency, task sensing decision, and caching strategy subproblems. When one task is re-sensing, the one-shot problem simplifies to the system latency minimization problem, which can be solved optimally. The task sensing decision is then made by comparing the system latency and AoI. Additionally, a Bayesian update strategy is developed to manage the cached task results. Building upon this framework, we propose a lightweight and time-efficient algorithm that makes real-time decisions for the long-term optimization problem. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.   This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, at 670 kV on the compact accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Seville, Spain, is now a reality. In this work, we present first Pu AMS results for environmental samples: a sediment core collected in a submarine canyon in the Mediterranean coast of the Spanish region of Palomares, affected by a nuclear accident in 1966. From the study of the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio profile, showing on average levels lower than 11%, we confirm that the weapon-grade plutonium released on land during the accident, with a characteristic 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of 5.8%, has found its way into the marine environment. A two-plutonium sources mixture model (Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium coming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring technique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples were also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS). The obtained AS 239+240Pu activity concentration results fit in with the AMS ones in a wide dynamic range, thus validating the AMS technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel yet simple and comprehensive DNS cache POisoning Prevention System (POPS), designed to integrate as a module in Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). POPS addresses statistical DNS poisoning attacks, including those documented from 2002 to the present, and offers robust protection against similar future threats. It consists of two main components: a detection module that employs three simple rules, and a mitigation module that leverages the TC flag in the DNS header to enhance security. Once activated, the mitigation module has zero false positives or negatives, correcting any such errors on the side of the detection module.   We first analyze POPS against historical DNS services and attacks, showing that it would have mitigated all network-based statistical poisoning attacks, yielding a success rate of only 0.0076% for the adversary. We then simulate POPS on traffic benchmarks (PCAPs) incorporating current potential network-based statistical poisoning attacks, and benign PCAPs; the simulated attacks still succeed with a probability of 0.0076%. This occurs because five malicious packets go through before POPS detects the attack and activates the mitigation module. In addition, POPS completes its task using only 20%-50% of the time required by other tools (e.g., Suricata or Snort), and after examining just 5%-10% as many packets. Furthermore, it successfully identifies DNS cache poisoning attacks-such as fragmentation attacks-that both Suricata and Snort fail to detect, underscoring its superiority in providing comprehensive DNS protection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) underscore the necessity of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to leverage external information. However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in language processing tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by high memory demands and computational complexity. Although low-bit quantization techniques, such as 4-bit quantization, present a potential solution, they frequently lead to significant accuracy degradation or require substantial effort for such aggressive quantization approaches. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QRazor, a reliable and effortless quantization scheme designed to enable 4-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. The scheme involves two main stages: quantization and compression. During the quantization stage, weights, activations, and KV cache values are quantized with wider 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis to achieve nearly identical accuracy to the original full-precision LLM models, using the absolute max scaling. Subsequently, all data are compressed to 4-bit using our proposed significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits while discarding the others. Furthermore, we present an integer-based arithmetic unit dedicated to QRazor, enabling direct low-precision arithmetic operations without decompressing the SDR data. Despite the reduced quantization effort, QRazor achieves LLM accuracies better or comparable to state-of-the-art 4-bit methods. By also validating the hardware efficiency, our decompression-free arithmetic unit achieves 61.2% and 57.8% reduction in area and power consumption, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: \emph{partitioning} and \emph{transmission}. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Delivering an immersive experience to virtual reality (VR) users through wireless connectivity offers the freedom to engage from anywhere at any time. Nevertheless, it is challenging to ensure seamless wireless connectivity that delivers real-time and high-quality videos to the VR users. This paper proposes a field of view (FoV) aware caching for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network. In particular, the FoV of each VR user is cached/prefetched at the base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. Specifically, decentralized and personalized federated learning (DP-FL) based caching strategies with guarantees are presented. Considering VR systems composed of multiple VR devices and BSs, a DP-FL caching algorithm is implemented at each BS to personalize content delivery for VR users. The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost of communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient descent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Additionally, to better account for the wireless channel dynamics, the FoVs are grouped into multicast or unicast groups based on the number of requesting VR users. The performance of the proposed DP-FL algorithm is validated through realistic VR head-tracking dataset, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have better performance in terms of average delay and cache hit as compared to baseline algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although applications involving long-context inputs are crucial for the effective utilization of large language models (LLMs), they also result in increased computational costs and reduced performance. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient, training-free prompt compression method that retains key information within compressed prompts. We identify specific attention heads in transformer-based LLMs, which we designate as evaluator heads, that are capable of selecting tokens in long inputs that are most significant for inference. Building on this discovery, we develop EHPC, an Evaluator Head-based Prompt Compression method, which enables LLMs to rapidly "skim through" input prompts by leveraging only the first few layers with evaluator heads during the pre-filling stage, subsequently passing only the important tokens to the model for inference. EHPC achieves state-of-the-art results across two mainstream benchmarks: prompt compression and long-context inference acceleration. Consequently, it effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with commercial API calls. We further demonstrate that EHPC attains competitive results compared to key-value cache-based acceleration methods, thereby highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency of LLMs for long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we study the coded caching scheme for the $(L, K, M, N)$ multi-user information retrieval (MIR) system, which consists of a content library containing $N$ files, a base station (BS) with $L$ antennas that cannot access the library, and $K$ single-antenna users, each of which can cache at most $M$ files from the library. The users communicate with the others assisted by the BS to decode their required files. In this paper, we focus on designing a coded caching scheme with low communication latency measured by normalized delivery time (NDT), computational complexity, and subpacketizations. When $\frac{KM}{N}\geq L$ we first simply the precoding matrix in the downlink step to an identity matrix and use the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output networks, to generate several new schemes for MIR system. Compared to the existing schemes, both the theoretical and numerical analyses show that our new schemes achieve much lower computational complexity and smaller subpacketizations with the same NDT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern GPUs, with their specialized hardware like tensor cores, are essential for demanding AI and deep learning applications. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-level microbenchmarking analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, delving into its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem latency and throughput, comparing its L2 partitioned cache behavior and global memory access patterns against recent GPU generations, Ampere and Ada Lovelace. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences and architectural improvements in Hopper. A core contribution of this work is a detailed evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores, including their FP8 precision support and the novel asynchronous wgmma instructions, assessing their impact on matrix multiply-accumulate operations. We further investigate the performance implications of other key Hopper innovations: DPX instructions for accelerating dynamic programming algorithms, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. This multi-level approach encompasses instruction-level microbenchmarks, library-level analysis of the Transformer Engine, and application-level benchmarks of tensor core performance within large language models. Our findings provide valuable, in-depth insights for software developers seeking to optimize performance and develop accurate performance models for the Hopper architecture, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of its potential for accelerating AI and other computationally intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous Integration (CI) consists of an automated build process involving continuous compilation, testing, and packaging of the software system. While CI comes up with several advantages related to quality and time to delivery, CI also presents several challenges addressed by a large body of research. To better understand the literature so as to help practitioners find solutions for their problems and guide future research, we conduct a systematic review of 97 studies on build optimization published between 2006 and 2024, which we summarized according to their goals, methodologies, used datasets, and leveraged metrics. The identified build optimization studies focus on two main challenges: (1) long build durations, and (2) build failures. To meet the first challenge, existing studies have developed a range of techniques, including predicting build outcome and duration, selective build execution, and build acceleration using caching or repairing performance smells. The causes of build failures have been the subject of several studies, leading to the development of techniques for predicting build script maintenance and automating repair. Recent studies have also focused on predicting flaky build failures caused by environmental issues. The majority of these techniques use machine learning algorithms and leverage build metrics, which we classify into five categories. Additionally, we identify eight publicly available build datasets for build optimization research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caching is an efficient technique to reduce peak traffic by storing popular content in local caches. Placement delivery array (PDA) proposed by Yan et al. is a combinatorial structure to design coded caching schemes with uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery. By taking the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a small base PDA, Wang et al. constructed a big PDA while maintaining the memory ratio and transmission load unchanged, which achieves linear growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain. In order to achieve exponential growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain, in this paper we propose a PDA construction by taking the union operation of the cache configurations from the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a base PDA. The resulting PDA leads to a coded caching scheme with subpacketization increasing sub-exponentially with the number of users while keeping the load constant for fixed memory ratio. By applying the proposed construction to existing base PDAs, three new coded caching schemes are obtained, which cover some existing schemes as special cases and can achieve lower load with simultaneously lower subpacketization for some memory ratios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their inference demands substantial resources, while under-utilizing high-end accelerators like GPUs. A major bottleneck arises from the attention mechanism, which requires storing large key-value caches, limiting the maximum achievable throughput way below the available computing resources. Current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through memory-efficient attention and paging mechanisms, but remained constrained by the assumption that all operations must be performed on high-end accelerators.   In this work, we propose Glinthawk, a two-tiered architecture that decouples the attention mechanism from the rest of the Transformer model. This approach allows the memory requirements for attention to scale independently, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient use of the high-end accelerators. We prototype Glinthawk with NVIDIA T4 GPUs as one tier and standard CPU VMs as the other. Compared to a traditional single-tier setup, it improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$. For longer sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-oriented applications such as batch processing. We shared our prototype publicly at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a two-layer hierarchical coded caching network where a server with a library of $N$ files is connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each having a cache memory of size $M_1$. Each mirror is further connected to $K_2$ users, each equipped with a dedicated cache of size $M_2$. In this paper, we propose two distinct coded caching schemes based on coded placement, corresponding to two distinct memory pairs, \( (M_1, M_2) \). We show that the proposed schemes outperform the existing schemes at these memory points given by the proposed schemes for smaller values of $K_2$. In setups where mirrors are positioned near each other, avoiding signal interference is crucial. This can be ensured by having all mirrors transmit using orthogonal carrier frequencies. To compare our schemes with existing ones, we used the composite rate metric, which accurately represents the total bandwidth utilized in such setups. The composite rate is given by $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to the mirrors, and $R_2$ is the rate from the mirrors to the users, with respect to $M_1$ and $M_2$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing popularity of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has led to its widespread application in various visual downstream tasks. To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol by introducing lazy latch-release and invalidation messages, thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-antenna coded caching (CC) with multicast beamforming often relies on complex successive interference cancellation (SIC) structures to decode a superposition of multiple streams received by each user. Traditional signal-level schemes require the regeneration of interfering signals from the cache, adding significant computational complexity. To address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling linear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data terms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies for constructing the coefficients matrix are considered: a random strategy, which lacks control over matrix construction, and an equal-distant strategy, which balances users' interference and data terms equally. In contrast, the proposed sparse strategy minimizes the number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval, simplifying the system while optimizing resource usage. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a successive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and optimize user ordering. With the coefficients matrix and optimized user ordering in place, multicast beamformers are refined to aggregate desired data from relevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the sparse strategy, demonstrating significant gains in symmetric rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine a two-layered hierarchical coded caching problem, a configuration addressed in existing research. This involves a server connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each of which serves $K_2$ users. The mirrors and the users are equipped with caches of size $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. We propose a hierarchical coded caching scheme with coded placements that outperforms existing schemes. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce the notion of composite rate, defined as $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to mirrors and $R_2$ is the rate from mirrors to users. The composite rate has not been discussed before in the literature and is pertinent when mirrors transmit with different carrier frequencies. For the proposed scheme, we show a trade-off between the global memory $\overline{M}=K_1M_1+K_1K_2M_2$ of the system and the composite rate and compare with the existing schemes. Additionally, we conduct this comparative analysis by plotting $R_1$ + $R_2$ against global memory, which is particularly beneficial for systems wherein each mirror can utilize the same carrier frequency, given their significant spatial separation. Additionally, we propose an optimized scheme for the specific case of a single mirror, showing improved performance in this scenario.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or "phantom" antenna users, bridging the performance gains of the min-G and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations, demonstrating the potential of content-aware MIMO-CC strategies for enhancing wireless network performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper considers wireless device-to-device (D2D) coded caching in a multiaccess network, where the users communicate with each other and each user can access multiple cache nodes. Access topologies derived from two combinatorial designs known as the $t$-design and $t$-group divisible design ($t$-GDD), referred to as the $t$-design and $t$-GDD topologies respectively, which subsume a few other known topologies, have been studied for the multiaccess coded caching (MACC) network by Cheng \textit{et al.} in \cite{MACC_des}. These access topologies are extended to a multiaccess D2D coded caching (MADCC) network and novel MADCC schemes are proposed. MADCC network has been studied so far only for the cyclic wrap-around topology. Apart from the proposed novel MADCC schemes, MADCC schemes are also derived from the existing MACC schemes in \cite{MACC_des}. To compare the performance of different MADCC schemes, the metrics of load per user and subpacketization level are used while keeping the number of caches and cache memory size same. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level while achieving the same load per user compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-design topology in \cite{MACC_des}. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of load per user while achieving the same subpacketization level compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-GDD topology in \cite{MACC_des} in some cases. Compared to the existing MADCC scheme with cyclic wrap-around topology, the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of load per user, and the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level at the expense of an increase in load per user.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The CXL-based solid-state drive (CXL-SSD) provides a promising approach towards scaling the main memory capacity at low cost. However, the CXL-SSD faces performance challenges due to the long flash access latency and unpredictable events such as garbage collection in the SSD device, stalling the host processor and wasting compute cycles. Although the CXL interface enables the byte-granular data access to the SSD, accessing flash chips is still at page granularity due to physical limitations. The mismatch of access granularity causes significant unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips, worsening the suboptimal end-to-end data access performance. In this paper, we present SkyByte, an efficient CXL-based SSD that employs a holistic approach to address the aforementioned challenges by co-designing the host operating system (OS) and SSD controller. To alleviate the long memory stall when accessing the CXL-SSD, SkyByte revisits the OS context switch mechanism and enables opportunistic context switches upon the detection of long access delays. To accommodate byte-granular data accesses, SkyByte architects the internal DRAM of the SSD controller into a cacheline-level write log and a page-level data cache, and enables data coalescing upon log cleaning to reduce the I/O traffic to flash chips. SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include adaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host memory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with a CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive applications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based SSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average. SkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes unlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Let k be a field, let G be an affine algebraic k-group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. We say V is rigid if the socle series and radical series coincide for the action of G on each indecomposable summand of V; say V is geometrically rigid (resp. absolutely rigid) if V is rigid after base change of G and V to k (resp. any field extension of k). We show that all simple G-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More precisely, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite purely inseparable extension kV /k naturally attached to V such that V is absolutely rigid as a G-module after base change to kV. The proof turns on an investigation of algebras of the form K otimes E where K and E are field extensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a module over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field extension kV /k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.   In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and representation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to give a concrete description of kV when G is smooth and connected. Namely, we combine the main structure theorem of the Conrad-Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with our previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the minimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of EndG(V) in terms of the high weight of V and the Conrad-Prasad classification data; this gives a concrete construction of the field kV as a subextension of the minimal field of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G. We also observe that the Conrad-Prasad classification can be used to hone the dimension formula for V we had previously established; we also use it to give a description of EndG(V) which includes a dimension formula.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a modern cloud server which occupies a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to the efficient operation of the machine, but unlike application-oriented compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency. Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path. However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernel-bypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

  Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly play an important role in a wide range of information processing and management tasks. Many of these tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that are about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache management. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the request-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill chunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the GPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared Attention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch overhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang by 1.3$\times$ to 10.8$\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical industry workload under different hardware environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-cache computing technology transforms existing caches into long-vector compute units and offers low-cost alternatives to building expensive vector engines for mobile CPUs. Unfortunately, existing long-vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, such as RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) and Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), provide only one-dimensional strided and random memory accesses. While this is sufficient for typical vector engines, it fails to effectively utilize the large Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) widths of in-cache vector engines. This is because mobile data-parallel kernels expose limited parallelism across a single dimension.   Based on our analysis of mobile vector kernels, we introduce a long-vector Multi-dimensional Vector ISA Extension (MVE) for mobile in-cache computing. MVE achieves high SIMD resource utilization and enables flexible programming by abstracting cache geometry and data layout. The proposed ISA features multi-dimensional strided and random memory accesses and efficient dimension-level masked execution to encode parallelism across multiple dimensions. Using a wide range of data-parallel mobile workloads, we demonstrate that MVE offers significant performance and energy reduction benefits of 2.9x and 8.8x, on average, compared to the SIMD units of a commercial mobile processor, at an area overhead of 3.6%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory-disk synchronization is a critical technology for ensuring data correctness, integrity, and security, especially in systems that handle sensitive information like financial transactions and medical records. We propose SYNC+SYNC, a group of attacks that exploit the memory-disk synchronization primitives. SYNC+SYNC works by subtly varying the timing of synchronization on the write buffer, offering several advantages: 1) implemented purely in software, enabling deployment on any hardware devices; 2) resilient against existing cache partitioning and randomization techniques; 3) unaffected by prefetching techniques and cache replacement strategies. We present the principles of SYNC+SYNC through the implementation of two write covert channel protocols, using either a single file or page, and introduce three enhanced strategies that utilize multiple files and pages. The feasibility of these channels is demonstrated in both cross-process and cross-sandbox scenarios across diverse operating systems (OSes). Experimental results show that, the average rate can reach 2.036 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 14.762 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0% on Linux; when running on macOS, the average rate achieves 10.211 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 253.022 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0.004%. To the best of our knowledge, SYNC+SYNC is the first high-speed write covert channel for software cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile edge Large Language Model (LLM) deployments face inherent constraints, such as limited computational resources and network bandwidth. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates some challenges by integrating external knowledge bases, inefficient cache management can still result in high retrieval latency and frequent cache updates. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Contextual Caching (ACC) framework that anticipates user needs by proactively caching semantically relevant data for mobile-edge LLMs. ACC utilizes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module to refine cache replacement policies, balancing user context, document similarity, and the overhead associated with cache misses. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC increases cache hit rates to over 80\% after only 11 training episodes, outperforming FIFO, LRU, and semantic-only caching while reducing retrieval latency by up to 40\%. In particular, ACC also reduces local caching overhead (i.e., the cost of updating the cache when a miss occurs) by as much as 55\%, enabling scalable, low-latency LLM services in resource-constrained edge environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as "cognitive dissonance" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These "cached" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is one of the most popular models in the world. However, serving diffusion models at the entire image level faces several problems, especially when there are multiple candidate resolutions. First, image based serving system prevents requests with different resolutions from batching together. On the other hand, requests with hybrid resolutions also indicate diverse locality features, which makes it hard to apply the same cache policy to all of them. To this end, we propose PATCHEDSERVE, A Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid Resolution Diffusion Serving that provides a patch-level management strategy to gather hybrid resolution requests into batches. Specifically, PATCHEDSERVE incorporates a novel patch-based processing workflow, significantly enhancing throughput for hybrid resolution inputs. Furthermore, PATCHEDSERVE designs a patch-level cache reuse policy to fully exploit the redundancy in diffusion. In addition, PATCHEDSERVE features an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm with lightweight online latency prediction, achieving higher SLO satisfaction rates. We show that PATCHEDSERVE can achieve 30.1 % higher SLO satisfaction compared to SOTA diffusion serving system while not hurt the image quality.

A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As multicore hardware is becoming increasingly common in real-time systems, traditional scheduling techniques that assume a single worst-case execution time for a task are no longer adequate, since they ignore the impact of shared resources on execution time. When tasks execute concurrently on different cores, their execution times often vary substantially with their allocated budgets of shared resources, such as cache and memory bandwidth. Even under a specific resource allocation, the resource use pattern of a task also changes with time during a job execution. It is therefore important to consider the relationship between multicore resources and execution time in task modeling and scheduling algorithm design.   In this paper, we propose a much more precise execution model for DAG-based real-time tasks that captures the time-varying resource use characteristics of a task under different budgets of shared resources. We present a generative resource profiling algorithm that efficiently predicts, from limited measurement data, the resource profile of a task at any time during its execution under a given resource budget. The generative profiles can then be used to construct the execution models for tasks, using which one can make informed resource allocation decisions. We further introduce a multicore resource allocation and deadline decomposition co-design technique for DAG-based tasks that leverages the generated execution models to jointly allocate resources and deadlines to subtasks, to maximize resource efficiency and schedulability. Our evaluation results show that our generative profiling algorithm achieves high accuracy while being efficient, and that our co-allocation technique substantially improves schedulability compared to a state-of-the-art deadline decomposition method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used across various applications, but their substantial computational requirements pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of HBM bandwidth bottlenecks and inter-device communication overhead. In this paper, we present PRESERVE, a novel prefetching framework designed to optimize LLM inference by overlapping memory reads for model weights and KV-cache with collective communication operations. Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient key-value (KV) cache compression is critical for scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in long sequences and resource-limited settings. Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models have emerged as one of the most widely used architectures for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation. The size of the state-of-the-art models has increased steadily reaching billions of parameters. These huge models are memory hungry and incur significant inference latency even on cutting edge AI-accelerators, such as GPUs. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of the attention operation is quadratic in terms of the total context length, i.e., prompt and output tokens. Thus, several optimizations such as key-value tensor caching and FlashAttention computation have been proposed to deliver the low latency demands of applications relying on such large models. However, these techniques do not cater to the computationally distinct nature of different phases during inference.   To that end, we propose LeanAttention, a scalable technique of computing self-attention for the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only transformer models. LeanAttention enables scaling the attention mechanism implementation for the challenging case of long context lengths by re-designing the execution flow for the decode-phase. We identify that the associative property of online softmax can be treated as a reduction operation thus allowing us to parallelize the attention computation over these large context lengths. We extend the "stream-K" style reduction of tiled calculation to self-attention to enable parallel computation resulting in an average of 2.6x attention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for 512k context lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse GEneral Matrix-matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines for a variety of different matrices on three Intel x86 architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is orders of magnitude faster than Intel MKL for several matrices. For massive random matrices that model social network graphs, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines fail to do so. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the shared-memory Graph Transposition (GT) problem, a fundamental graph algorithm that is widely used in graph analytics and scientific computing.   Previous GT algorithms have significant memory requirements that are proportional to the number of vertices and threads which obstructs their use on large graphs. Moreover, atomic memory operations have become comparably fast on recent CPU architectures, which creates new opportunities for improving the performance of concurrent atomic accesses in GT.   We design PoTra, a GT algorithm which leverages graph structure and processor and memory architecture to optimize locality and performance. PoTra limits the size of additional data structures close to CPU cache sizes and utilizes the skewed degree distribution of graph datasets to optimize locality and performance. We present the performance model of PoTra to explain the connection between cache and memory response times and graph locality.   Our evaluation of PoTra on three CPU architectures and 20 real-world and synthetic graph datasets with up to 128 billion edges demonstrates that PoTra achieves up to 8.7 times speedup compared to previous works and if there is a performance loss it remains limited to 15.7%, on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Private large language model (LLM) inference based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) offers cryptographically-secure protection for both user prompt and proprietary model weights. However, it suffers from large latency overhead especially for long input sequences. While key-value (KV) cache eviction algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computation and memory cost for plaintext inference, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit private inference easily. In this paper, we propose an accurate and MPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache. MPCache is built on the observation that historical tokens in a long sequence may have different effects on the downstream decoding. Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static eviction algorithm to discard unimportant tokens and a query-aware dynamic selection algorithm to further select a small subset of tokens for attention computation. As existing dynamic selection algorithms incur too much latency, we propose a series of optimizations to drastically reduce the KV cache selection overhead, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation, hierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index sharing strategy. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms prior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different LLM generation tasks and achieves 1.8~2.01x and 3.39~8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction on different sequence lengths, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequence parallelism (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single device. However, for linear sequence modeling methods like linear attention, existing SP approaches do not take advantage of their right-product-first feature, resulting in sub-optimal communication efficiency and usability. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (LASP), an efficient SP approach designed for linear attention-based transformer models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point ring-style communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead, comparing with existing SP methods. We enhance the computation efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPUs. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with very-long sequences. We also discuss the generalization of LASP on other linear sequence modeling methods. Extensive experiments on linear attention-based models are conducted with varying sequence lengths from 2K to 4096K. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K on 128 GPUs, which is 8$\times$ longer than existing SP methods. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving large language models (LLMs) for massive users is challenged by the significant memory footprint of the transient state, known as the key-value (KV) cache, which scales with sequence length and number of requests. Instead of renting or buying more expensive GPUs, the load imbalance of the KV cache across GPUs, coupled with recent advances in inter-GPU communication, provides an opportunity to serve more requests via request migration. However, high migration overhead and unpredictable request patterns make it challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes MELL, a memory-efficient LLM serving system via multi-GPU KV cache management. It saves the number of GPUs needed in the system by considering the dynamic KV cache load and the costly request migration. Specifically, we first develop an adaptive request migration mechanism to balance the computational and communication overheads and adapt to diverse resource conditions. Then, we design an online algorithm tailored to a multi-LLM request and multi-GPU scheduling problem with migration enabled. It aims to minimise the required GPUs while limiting the number of migrations. Finally, we implement a prototype of MELL and demonstrate that it reduces the number of GPUs by 31% and increases the GPU utilization by 43% at most compared to existing LLM serving systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.   The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at https://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in personalized speech generation have brought synthetic speech increasingly close to the realism of target speakers' recordings, yet multimodal speaker generation remains on the rise. This paper introduces UniSpeaker, a unified approach for multimodality-driven speaker generation. Specifically, we propose a unified voice aggregator based on KV-Former, applying soft contrastive loss to map diverse voice description modalities into a shared voice space, ensuring that the generated voice aligns more closely with the input descriptions. To evaluate multimodality-driven voice control, we build the first multimodality-based voice control (MVC) benchmark, focusing on voice suitability, voice diversity, and speech quality. UniSpeaker is evaluated across five tasks using the MVC benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that UniSpeaker outperforms previous modality-specific models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present a criterion for $(K,v)$ to be henselian and defectless in terms of finite complete sequences of key polynomials. For this, we use the theory of Mac Lane-Vaqui\'e chains and abstract key polynomials. We then prove that a valued field $(K,v)$ is tame if and only if $vK$ is $p$-divisible, $Kv$ is perfect and every simple algebraic extension of $K$ admits a finite complete sequence of key polynomials. The properties $vK$ $p$-divisible and $Kv$ perfect are described by the Frobenius endomorphism on the associated graded ring. We also make considerations on simply defectless and algebraically maximal valued fields and purely inertial and purely ramified extensions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based networks in urban environments characterized by blockages, focusing on their capability to support the service demands of mobile users. The UAV-base stations (UAV-BSs) are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked- Poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-BS. Leveraging stochastic geometry, we analyze the impact of blockages on network reliability by studying the meta distribution (MD) of the signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) for a specific reliability threshold and the association probabilities for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of mobile users, we propose a novel cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE), thus reducing latency, ensuring seamless connectivity, and maintaining the quality of service (QoS). This study provides valuable insights into optimizing UAV network deployments to support the stringent requirements in the network, ensuring reliable, low-latency, and high-throughput communication for next-generation smart cities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unlike non-volatile memory that resides on the processor memory bus, memory-semantic solid-state drives (SSDs) support both byte and block access granularity via PCIe or CXL interconnects. They provide scalable memory capacity using NAND flash at a much lower cost. In addition, they have different performance characteristics for their dual byte/block interface respectively, while offering essential memory semantics for upper-level software. Such a byte-accessible storage device provides new implications on the software system design.   In this paper, we develop a new file system, named ByteFS, by rethinking the design primitives of file systems and SSD firmware to exploit the advantages of both byte and block-granular data accesses. ByteFS supports byte-granular data persistence to retain the persistence nature of SSDs. It extends the core data structure of file systems by enabling dual byte/block-granular data accesses. To facilitate the support for byte-granular writes, \pname{} manages the internal DRAM of SSD firmware in a log-structured manner and enables data coalescing to reduce the unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips. ByteFS also enables coordinated data caching between the host page cache and SSD cache for best utilizing the precious memory resource. We implement ByteFS on both a real programmable SSD and an emulated memory-semantic SSD for sensitivity study. Compared to state-of-the-art file systems for non-volatile memory and conventional SSDs, ByteFS outperforms them by up to 2.7$\times$, while preserving the essential properties of a file system. ByteFS also reduces the write traffic to SSDs by up to 5.1$\times$ by alleviating unnecessary writes caused by both metadata and data updates in file systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In cloud databases, cloud computation over sensitive data uploaded by clients inevitably causes concern about data security and privacy. Even when encryption primitives and trusted computing environments are integrated into query processing to safeguard the actual contents of the data, access patterns of algorithms can still leak private information about the data. Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) and circuits are two generic approaches to address this issue, ensuring that access patterns of algorithms remain oblivious to the data. However, deploying these methods on insecure algorithms, particularly for multi-way join processing, is computationally expensive and inherently challenging.   In this paper, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm for multi-way join processing that operates without relying on ORAM simulations or other security assumptions. Our algorithm is a non-trivial, provably oblivious composition of basic primitives, with time complexity matching the insecure worst-case optimal join algorithm, up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, it is cache-agnostic, with cache complexity matching the insecure lower bound, also up to a logarithmic factor. This clean and straightforward approach has the potential to be extended to other security settings and implemented in practical database systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the exponential rise in the use of cloud services, smart devices, and IoT devices, advanced cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of computing architectures and memory technologies has created an urgent need to understand and address hardware security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review the current state of vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies in contemporary computing systems. We discuss cache side-channel attacks (including Spectre and Meltdown), power side-channel attacks (such as Simple Power Analysis, Differential Power Analysis, Correlation Power Analysis, and Template Attacks), and advanced techniques like Voltage Glitching and Electromagnetic Analysis to help understand and build robust cybersecurity defense systems and guide further research. We also examine memory encryption, focusing on confidentiality, granularity, key management, masking, and re-keying strategies. Additionally, we cover Cryptographic Instruction Set Architectures, Secure Boot, Root of Trust mechanisms, Physical Unclonable Functions, and hardware fault injection techniques. The paper concludes with an analysis of the RISC-V architecture's unique security challenges. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is essential for building resilient hardware security solutions that can protect against both current and emerging threats in an increasingly challenging security landscape.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks, quickly becoming one of the most prevalent AI workloads. Yet the substantial memory requirement of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment for end users. Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as one of the most hardware-efficient methods to mitigate the memory and computational demands of LLMs. Although the traditional integer (INT) datatype has received widespread adoption in PTQ methods, floating-point (FP) quantization has emerged as a viable alternative thanks to its effectiveness in fitting LLM numerical distributions. However, the FP datatype in sign-magnitude binary representation contains both positive and negative zero, which constrains its representation capability, particularly under low precision (3 and 4 bits). In this paper, we extend the basic FP datatype to perform Redundant Zero Remapping (RaZeR), which remaps the negative zero FP encoding to a set of pre-defined special values to maximally utilize FP quantization encodings and to better fit LLM numerical distributions. Through careful selection of special values, RaZeR outperforms conventional asymmetric INT quantization while achieving high computational efficiency. We demonstrate that RaZeR can be seamlessly integrated with quantization algorithms for both weights and KV-cache, including advanced methods with clipping and transformations, and consistently achieve better model accuracy. Additionally, we implement a fast GEMV kernel with fused dequantization that efficiently converts the 4-bit RaZeR value to FP16 through novel bit-level manipulation. On modern GPUs, our evaluation shows that RaZeR improves the GEMV speed by up to 7.56$\times$ compared to the FP16 implementation, while achieving up to 2.72$\times$ speedup in the LLM decoding throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (>~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), which focuses on finding collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial in autonomous warehouse operations. Lifelong MAPF (L-MAPF), where agents are continuously reassigned new targets upon completing their current tasks, offers a more realistic approximation of real-world warehouse scenarios. While cache storage systems can enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs, existing approaches primarily rely on expectations and mathematical models, often without adequately addressing the challenges of multi-robot planning and execution. In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism called Lifelong MAPF with Cache Mechanism (L-MAPF-CM), which integrates high-level cache storage with low-level path planning. We have involved a new type of map grid called cache for temporary item storage. Additionally, we involved a task assigner (TA) with a locking mechanism to bridge the gap between the new cache grid and L-MAPF algorithm. The TA dynamically allocates target locations to agents based on their status in various scenarios. We evaluated L-MAPF-CM using different cache replacement policies and task distributions. L-MAPF-CM has demonstrated performance improvements particularly with high cache hit rates and smooth traffic conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a promising technology for memory disaggregation and expansion. Especially, CXL makes it more effectively for large-capacity storage devices such as Solid State Drive (SSD) to be deployed in the memory pool. However, CXL-based SSDs are still in early stages, necessitating the development of reliable simulation tools. In this paper, we propose CXL-SSD-Sim, the first open-source full-system simulator designed to simulate CXL-based SSD memory system. Constructed on the foundation of gem5 and SimpleSSD, CXL-SSD-Sim extends an high fidelity SSD memory expander model along with the corresponding device driver. In addition, CXL-SSD-Sim models a DRAM layer as a caching mechanism for the SSD, meticulously engineered to counteract latency issues inherent to CXL-based SSD memory access. Experiments are performed among five different memory devices with CXL-SSD-Sim in aspect of latency, bandwidth and real-world benchmark performance. These experiments serve to underscore the efficacy of our simulation tool in providing a comprehensive analysis of CXL-based SSD memory systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training transformer-based encoder-decoder models for long document summarization poses a significant challenge due to the quadratic memory consumption during training. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still difficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch between training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient $\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an approach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based encoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation. Specifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents, followed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached at the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the hidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long document summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than 500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using any additional parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) with enormous model sizes use many GPUs to meet memory capacity requirements incurring substantial costs for token generation. To provide cost-effective LLM inference with relaxed latency constraints, extensive research has focused on expanding GPU memory by leveraging the host memory. However, LLM inference engines that utilize the host memory often face underutilization of GPU compute units, as a considerable portion of inference time is spent in loading the model onto the GPU via host-GPU interconnect. To tackle these challenges of the host memory offloading for LLM, we introduce HybridServe, an LLM inference system with activation checkpointing based on activation caching. The activation cache stores activation checkpoints generated during intermediate inference stages, allowing the fast recomputation of KV cache while model parameters are transferred to GPU from host memory. Unlike conventional methods that recompute the KV cache from scratch using token IDs, the activation cache allows bypassing projection and FFN operations. To balance between the activation recomputation and parameter loading overhead, this study proposes a KV-activation hybrid caching scheme which finds the best ratio of the key-value and activation caches to adjust the recomputation time. Our system achieves 2.19x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art prior work for offloading both model weights and KV cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a method for composing object-level visual prompts within a text-to-image diffusion model. Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based LLMs have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating high-quality, high-dimensional images. Nevertheless, these models are hindered by their high computational cost and slow inference, partly due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention mechanisms with respect to input size. Various approaches have been proposed to address this drawback. One such approach focuses on reducing the number of tokens fed into the self-attention, known as token merging (ToMe). In our method, which is called cached adaptive token merging(CA-ToMe), we calculate the similarity between tokens and then merge the r proportion of the most similar tokens. However, due to the repetitive patterns observed in adjacent steps and the variation in the frequency of similarities, we aim to enhance this approach by implementing an adaptive threshold for merging tokens and adding a caching mechanism that stores similar pairs across several adjacent steps. Empirical results demonstrate that our method operates as a training-free acceleration method, achieving a speedup factor of 1.24 in the denoising process while maintaining the same FID scores compared to existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and processing power. In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stable Diffusion has achieved remarkable success in the field of text-to-image generation, with its powerful generative capabilities and diverse generation results making a lasting impact. However, its iterative denoising introduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting broader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this computational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention due to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features computed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to become similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately compromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a dynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of feature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing only high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby extending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with token pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise information reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach delivered a 9$\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced image quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\times$ acceleration coupled with a notable FID reduction of 2.17.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

  Image Recognition</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ultra-fine-grained image recognition (UFGIR) is a challenging task that involves classifying images within a macro-category. While traditional FGIR deals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying sub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times the usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain outstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a significant cost in terms of computation specially since this task significantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore, techniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational cost. However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for fine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced. Therefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token reduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a Cross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous layers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs across diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction methods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy vs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to 10\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%. The model and code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMD0311/HERMES.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.

PPBoot is applicable to arbitrary estimation problems and is very simple to implement, essentially only requiring one application of the bootstrap. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that PPBoot often performs nearly identically to (and sometimes better than) the earlier PPI(++) method based on asymptotic normality$\unicode{x2013}$when the latter is applicable$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring any asymptotic characterizations. Given its versatility, PPBoot could simplify and expand the scope of application of prediction-powered inference to problems where central limit theorems are hard to prove.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs are increasingly deployed in global applications, the importance of cultural sensitivity becomes paramount, ensuring that users from diverse backgrounds feel respected and understood. Cultural harm can arise when these models fail to align with specific cultural norms, resulting in misrepresentations or violations of cultural values. This work addresses the challenges of ensuring cultural sensitivity in LLMs, especially in small-parameter models that often lack the extensive training data needed to capture global cultural nuances. We present two key contributions: (1) A cultural harm test dataset, created to assess model outputs across different cultural contexts through scenarios that expose potential cultural insensitivities, and (2) A culturally aligned preference dataset, aimed at restoring cultural sensitivity through fine-tuning based on feedback from diverse annotators. These datasets facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of LLMs, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment across different cultural landscapes. Our results show that integrating culturally aligned feedback leads to a marked improvement in model behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating culturally insensitive or harmful content. Ultimately, this work paves the way for more inclusive and respectful AI systems, fostering a future where LLMs can safely and ethically navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare. In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in natural language processing have leveraged instruction tuning to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, previous works train different base models with different training data, lacking an apples-to-apples comparison across the result table LLMs. To address this, we fine-tune base models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families on existing public training datasets. Our replication achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing table LLMs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on Hitab, a table question-answering dataset. More importantly, through systematic out-of-domain evaluation, we decouple the contributions of training data and the base model, providing insight into their individual impacts. In addition, we assess the effects of table-specific instruction tuning on general-purpose benchmarks, revealing trade-offs between specialization and generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has created a critical need for techniques that enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices without compromising performance. We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.

This new domain necessitates the creation of datasets of reasoning tasks for both training and benchmarking the performance of LLMs. To this end, we introduce the Karp dataset: The first dataset composed of detailed proofs of NP-completeness reductions. The reductions vary in difficulty, ranging from simple exercises of undergraduate courses to more challenging reductions from academic papers. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art models on this task and demonstrate the effect of fine-tuning with the Karp dataset on reasoning capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Rongzhao-He/surface-vision-mamba.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Recently, a line of message-passing-based research has been proposed to solve CQA. However, they perform unsatisfactorily on negative queries and fail to address the noisy messages between variable nodes in the query graph. Moreover, they offer little interpretability and require complex query data and resource-intensive training. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Message Passing (NSMP) framework based on pre-trained neural link predictors. By introducing symbolic reasoning and fuzzy logic, NSMP can generalize to arbitrary existential first order logic queries without requiring training while providing interpretable answers. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy to filter out noisy messages between variable nodes. Experimental results show that NSMP achieves a strong performance. Additionally, through complexity analysis and empirical verification, we demonstrate the superiority of NSMP in inference time over the current state-of-the-art neural-symbolic method. Compared to this approach, NSMP demonstrates faster inference times across all query types on benchmark datasets, with speedup ranging from 2$\times$ to over 150$\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To achieve generalized and robust natural-to-formal language conversion (N2F), large language models (LLMs) need to have strong capabilities of decomposition and composition in N2F when faced with an unfamiliar formal language and be able to cope with compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names. To investigate whether LLMs have this set of basic capabilities in N2F, we propose the DEDC framework. This framework semi-automatically performs sample and task construction, allowing decoupled evaluation of the set of decomposition and composition capabilities of LLMs in N2F. Based on this framework, we evaluate and analyze the most advanced LLMs, and the main findings include that: (1) the LLMs are deficient in both decomposition and composition; (2) the LLMs show a wide coverage of error types that can be attributed to deficiencies in natural language understanding and the learning and use of symbolic systems; (3) compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names both affect the decomposition and composition of the LLMs. Our work provides a new perspective for investigating the basic capabilities of decomposition and composition of LLMs in N2F. The detailed analysis of deficiencies and attributions can help subsequent improvements of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we propose a novel ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that considers the multiband and non-uniform cadence without having to compute complex features. Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of RNNs, which do not require the entire light curve to perform inference, making the inference process simpler. The ensemble is able to adapt to varying numbers of bands, tested on three real light curve datasets, namely Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, and ZTF, to demonstrate its potential for generalization. We also show the capabilities of deep learning to perform not only classification, but also regression of physical parameters such as effective temperature and radius. Our ensemble model demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with fewer observations, thus providing potential for early classification of sources from facilities such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. The results underline the model's effectiveness and flexibility, making it a promising tool for future astronomical surveys. Our research has shown that a multitask learning approach can enrich the embeddings obtained by the models, making them instrumental to solve additional tasks, such as determining the orbital parameters of binary systems or estimating parameters for object types beyond periodic ones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Vision Token Turing Machines (ViTTM), an efficient, low-latency, memory-augmented Vision Transformer (ViT). Our approach builds on Neural Turing Machines and Token Turing Machines, which were applied to NLP and sequential visual understanding tasks. ViTTMs are designed for non-sequential computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Our model creates two sets of tokens: process tokens and memory tokens; process tokens pass through encoder blocks and read-write from memory tokens at each encoder block in the network, allowing them to store and retrieve information from memory. By ensuring that there are fewer process tokens than memory tokens, we are able to reduce the inference time of the network while maintaining its accuracy. On ImageNet-1K, the state-of-the-art ViT-B has median latency of 529.5ms and 81.0% accuracy, while our ViTTM-B is 56% faster (234.1ms), with 2.4 times fewer FLOPs, with an accuracy of 82.9%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Citizen reporting platforms like Safe City in India help the public and authorities stay informed about sexual harassment incidents. However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice.   We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is often hindered by the disconnect between the needs of domain experts and translating these needs into robust and valid ML tools. Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs) have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons' spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by generating more informative and discriminative latent representations, improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in neuroscience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain generalization aims to find ways for deep learning models to maintain their performance despite significant domain shifts between training and inference datasets. This is particularly important for models that need to be robust or are costly to train. LiDAR perception in autonomous driving is impacted by both of these concerns, leading to the emergence of various approaches. This work addresses the challenge by proposing a geometry-based approach, leveraging the sequential structure of LiDAR sensors, which sets it apart from the learning-based methods commonly found in the literature. The proposed method, called 3DLabelProp, is applied on the task of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation (LSS). Through extensive experimentation on seven datasets, it is demonstrated to be a state-of-the-art approach, outperforming both naive and other domain generalization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Incorporating equivariance as an inductive bias into deep learning architectures to take advantage of the data symmetry has been successful in multiple applications, such as chemistry and dynamical systems. In particular, roto-translations are crucial for effectively modeling geometric graphs and molecules, where understanding the 3D structures enhances generalization. However, equivariant models often pose challenges due to their high computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce REMUL, a training procedure for approximating equivariance with multitask learning. We show that unconstrained models (which do not build equivariance into the architecture) can learn approximate symmetries by minimizing an additional simple equivariance loss. By formulating equivariance as a new learning objective, we can control the level of approximate equivariance in the model. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to equivariant baselines while being $10 \times$ faster at inference and $2.5 \times$ at training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In various applications, the potential outcome of a unit may be influenced by the treatments received by other units, a phenomenon known as interference, as well as by prior treatments, referred to as carryover effects. These phenomena violate the stable unit treatment value assumption and pose significant challenges in causal inference. To address these complexities, we propose a minimax optimal experimental design that simultaneously accounts for both spillover and carryover effects, enhancing the precision of estimates for direct and spillover effects. This method is particularly applicable to multi-unit experiments, reducing sample size requirements and experimental costs. We also investigate the asymptotic properties of the Horvitz--Thompson estimators of direct and spillover effects, demonstrating their consistency and asymptotic normality under the minimax optimal design. To facilitate valid inferences, we propose conservative variance estimators. Furthermore, we tackle the challenges associated with potential misspecifications in the order of carryover effects. Our approach is validated by comprehensive numerical studies that demonstrate superior performance compared to existing experimental designs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This dissertation explores the design and implementation of programming languages that represent rounding error analysis through typing.   The first part of this dissertation demonstrates that it is possible to design languages for forward error analysis, as illustrated with NumFuzz, a functional programming language whose type system expresses quantitative bounds on rounding error. This type system combines a sensitivity analysis, enforced through a linear typing discipline, with a novel graded monad to track the accumulation of rounding errors. We establish the soundness of the type system by relating the denotational semantics of the language to both an exact and floating-point operational semantics. To demonstrate the practical utility of NumFuzz as a tool for automated error analysis, we have developed a prototype implementation capable of automatically inferring error bounds. Our implementation produces bounds competitive with existing tools, while often achieving significantly faster analysis times.   The second part of this dissertation explores a type-based approach to backward error analysis with Bean, a first-order programming language with a linear type system that can express quantitative bounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated backward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from numerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error bounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype implementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically. Our evaluation shows that these inferred bounds match worst-case theoretical relative backward error bounds from the literature.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs), pose significant challenges to upholding academic integrity in higher education. This paper investigates the susceptibility of a Master's-level cyber security degree program at a UK Russell Group university, accredited by a leading national body, to LLM misuse. Through the application and extension of a quantitative assessment framework, we identify a high exposure to misuse, particularly in independent project- and report-based assessments. Contributing factors, including block teaching and a predominantly international cohort, are highlighted as potential amplifiers of these vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, we discuss the adoption of LLM-resistant assessments, detection tools, and the importance of fostering an ethical learning environment. These approaches aim to uphold academic standards while preparing students for the complexities of real-world cyber security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Radiologists have preferred visual impressions or 'styles' of X-ray images that are manually adjusted to their needs to support their diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose an automatic and interpretable X-ray style transfer by introducing a trainable version of the Local Laplacian Filter (LLF). From the shape of the LLF's optimized remap function, the characteristics of the style transfer can be inferred and reliability of the algorithm can be ensured. Moreover, we enable the LLF to capture complex X-ray style features by replacing the remap function with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and adding a trainable normalization layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by transforming unprocessed mammographic X-ray images into images that match the style of target mammograms and achieve a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.94 compared to 0.82 of the baseline LLF style transfer method from Aubry et al.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy--black hole scaling relations at $z=6$ to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at $z>6$. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of supermassive black hole mass at $z>6$ does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at $z>6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\ge$10 smaller than the total black hole mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity and mass functions as well as accretion modes, and is likely still at least a factor $>$2 smaller when accounting for the known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: $>$90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV--visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetime arguments for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at $z>6$, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backward error analysis offers a method for assessing the quality of numerical programs in the presence of floating-point rounding errors. However, techniques from the numerical analysis literature for quantifying backward error require substantial human effort, and there are currently no tools or automated methods for statically deriving sound backward error bounds. To address this gap, we propose Bean, a typed first-order programming language designed to express quantitative bounds on backward error. Bean's type system combines a graded coeffect system with strict linearity to soundly track the flow of backward error through programs. We prove the soundness of our system using a novel categorical semantics, where every Bean program denotes a triple of related transformations that together satisfy a backward error guarantee.   To illustrate Bean's potential as a practical tool for automated backward error analysis, we implement a variety of standard algorithms from numerical linear algebra in Bean, establishing fine-grained backward error bounds via typing in a compositional style. We also develop a prototype implementation of Bean that infers backward error bounds automatically. Our evaluation shows that these inferred bounds match worst-case theoretical relative backward error bounds from the literature, underscoring Bean's utility in validating a key property of numerical programs: numerical stability.

Although LLMs were originally designed for natural language understanding, their adaptability to multimodal tasks, including geospatial analysis, has opened new frontiers in data-driven research. By leveraging advancements in vision-enabled LLMs, we assess their ability to provide interpretable, scalable, and reliable insights into human poverty from satellite images. Using a pairwise comparison approach, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can rank satellite images based on poverty levels with accuracy comparable to domain experts. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of LLMs in socioeconomic research, providing a foundation for their integration into poverty assessment workflows. This study contributes to the ongoing exploration of unconventional data sources for welfare analysis and opens pathways for cost-effective, large-scale poverty monitoring.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-hoc calibration of pre-trained models is critical for ensuring reliable inference, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a robust post-hoc calibration framework, providing distribution-free statistical coverage guarantees for prediction sets by leveraging held-out datasets. In this work, we address a decentralized setting where each device has limited calibration data and can communicate only with its neighbors over an arbitrary graph topology. We propose two message-passing-based approaches for achieving reliable inference via CP: quantile-based distributed conformal prediction (Q-DCP) and histogram-based distributed conformal prediction (H-DCP). Q-DCP employs distributed quantile regression enhanced with tailored smoothing and regularization terms to accelerate convergence, while H-DCP uses a consensus-based histogram estimation approach. Through extensive experiments, we investigate the trade-offs between hyperparameter tuning requirements, communication overhead, coverage guarantees, and prediction set sizes across different network topologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gaussian splatting (GS) for 3D reconstruction has become quite popular due to their fast training, inference speeds and high quality reconstruction. However, GS-based reconstructions generally consist of millions of Gaussians, which makes them hard to use on computationally constrained devices such as smartphones. In this paper, we first propose a principled analysis of advances in efficient GS methods. Then, we propose Trick-GS, which is a careful combination of several strategies including (1) progressive training with resolution, noise and Gaussian scales, (2) learning to prune and mask primitives and SH bands by their significance, and (3) accelerated GS training framework. Trick-GS takes a large step towards resource-constrained GS, where faster run-time, smaller and faster-convergence of models is of paramount concern. Our results on three datasets show that Trick-GS achieves up to 2x faster training, 40x smaller disk size and 2x faster rendering speed compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of deep learning has sparked significant interest in designing computer hardware optimized for the high computational demands of neural network inference. As further miniaturization of digital CMOS processors becomes increasingly challenging, alternative computing paradigms, such as analog computing, are gaining consideration. Particularly for compute-intensive tasks such as matrix multiplication, analog computing presents a promising alternative due to its potential for significantly higher energy efficiency compared to conventional digital technology. However, analog computations are inherently noisy, which makes it challenging to maintain high accuracy on deep neural networks. This work investigates the effectiveness of training neural networks with quantization to increase the robustness against noise. Experimental results across various network architectures show that quantization-aware training with constant scaling factors enhances robustness. We compare these methods with noisy training, which incorporates a noise injection during training that mimics the noise encountered during inference. While both two methods increase tolerance against noise, noisy training emerges as the superior approach for achieving robust neural network performance, especially in complex neural architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural networks have become a fundamental component of numerous practical applications, and their implementations, which are often accelerated by hardware, are integrated into all types of real-world physical devices. User interactions with neural networks on hardware accelerators are commonly considered privacy-sensitive. Substantial efforts have been made to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance privacy protection at the level of machine learning algorithms, including membership inference attacks, differential privacy, and federated learning. However, neural networks are ultimately implemented and deployed on physical devices, and current research pays comparatively less attention to privacy protection at the implementation level. In this paper, we introduce a generic physical side-channel attack, ScaAR, that extracts user interactions with neural networks by leveraging electromagnetic (EM) emissions of physical devices. Our proposed attack is implementation-agnostic, meaning it does not require the adversary to possess detailed knowledge of the hardware or software implementations, thanks to the capabilities of deep learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA). Experimental results demonstrate that, through the EM side channel, ScaAR can effectively extract the class label of user interactions with neural classifiers, including inputs and outputs, on the AMD-Xilinx MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA and Raspberry Pi 3 B. In addition, for the first time, we provide side-channel analysis on edge Large Language Model (LLM) implementations on the Raspberry Pi 5, showing that EM side channel leaks interaction data, and different LLM tokens can be distinguishable from the EM traces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We compare current 1D and multi-dimensional atmosphere modelling approaches for massive stars to understand their strengths and shortcomings. We calculate averaged stratifications from selected 2D calculations for O stars -- corresponding to the spectral types O8, O4, and O2 -- to approximate them with 1D stellar atmosphere models using the PoWR model atmosphere code and assuming a fixed $\beta-$law for the wind regime. We then study the effects of our approximations and assumptions on current spectral diagnostics. In particular, we focus on the impact of an additional turbulent pressure in the subsonic layers of the 1D models. To match the 2D averages, the 1D stellar atmosphere models need to account for turbulent pressure in the hydrostatic equation. Moreover, an adjustment of the connection point between the (quasi-)hydrostatic regime and the wind regime is required. The improvement between the density stratification of 1D model and 2D average can be further increased if the mass-loss rate of the 1D model is not identical to those of the 2D simulation, but typically $\sim0.2\,$dex higher. Especially for the early type star, this implies a significantly more extended envelope with a lower effective temperature. Already the inclusion of a constant turbulence term in the solution of the hydrostatic equation sufficiently reproduces the 2D-averaged model density stratifications. The addition of a significant turbulent motion also smoothens the slope of the radiative acceleration term in the (quasi-)hydrostatic domain, with several potential implications on the total mass-loss rate inferred from 1D modelling. Concerning the spectral synthesis, the addition of a turbulence term in the hydrostatic equation mimics the effect of a lower surface gravity, potentially presenting a solution to the ``mass discrepancy problem'' between the evolutionary and spectroscopy mass determinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness across various domains, with data augmentation methods utilizing GPT for synthetic data generation becoming prevalent. However, the quality and utility of augmented data remain questionable, and current methods lack clear metrics for evaluating data characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose ResoFilter, a novel method that integrates models, data, and tasks to refine datasets. ResoFilter leverages the fine-tuning process to obtain Data-Parameter features for data selection, offering improved interpretability by representing data characteristics through model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that ResoFilter achieves comparable results to full-scale fine-tuning using only half the data in mathematical tasks and exhibits strong generalization across different models and domains. This method provides valuable insights for constructing synthetic datasets and evaluating high-quality data, offering a promising solution for enhancing data augmentation techniques and improving training dataset quality for LLMs. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential across various tasks. However, research for exploring and improving the capabilities of LLMs in interpreting graph structures remains limited. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompting current open-source LLMs on graph-to-text generation tasks. Although we explored the optimal prompting strategies and proposed a novel and effective diversity-difficulty-based few-shot sample selection method, we found that the improvements from tuning-free approaches were incremental, as LLMs struggle with planning on complex graphs, particularly those with a larger number of triplets. To further improve LLMs in planning with graph sequences and grounding in truth, we introduce a new graph-to-text dataset, PlanGTG, annotated with two sub-tasks: reordering and attribution. Through extensive automatic and human evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of generated text from both few-shot learning and fine-tuning perspectives using the PlanGTG dataset. Our study paves the way for new research directions in graph-to-text generation. PlanGTG datasets can be found in https://github.com/probe2/kg_text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and 3D convolution (Conv3D) show impressive results for many video-based applications but require large memory and intensive computing. Motivated by recent works on hardware-algorithmic co-design towards efficient inference, we propose a compact binarized Conv3D-LSTM model architecture called BILLNET, compatible with a highly resource-constrained hardware. Firstly, BILLNET proposes to factorize the costly standard Conv3D by two pointwise convolutions with a grouped convolution in-between. Secondly, BILLNET enables binarized weights and activations via a MUX-OR-gated residual architecture. Finally, to efficiently train BILLNET, we propose a multi-stage training strategy enabling to fully quantize LSTM layers. Results on Jester dataset show that our method can obtain high accuracy with extremely low memory and computational budgets compared to existing Conv3D resource-efficient models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) hold promise for energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing. We identify substantial informatio loss during spike transmission, linked to temporal dependencies in traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron-a key factor potentially limiting SNN performance. Existing SNN architectures also underutilize modern GPUs, constrained by single-bit spike storage and isolated weight-spike operations that restrict computational efficiency. We introduce ${SpikePack}$, a neuron model designed to reduce transmission loss while preserving essential features like membrane potential reset and leaky integration. ${SpikePack}$ achieves constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexity, enabling efficient parallel processing on GPUs and also supporting serial inference on existing SNN hardware accelerators. Compatible with standard Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, ${SpikePack}$ facilitates near-lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion across various networks. Experimental results on tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation show ${SpikePack}$ achieves significant gains in accuracy and efficiency for both directly trained and converted SNNs over state-of-the-art models. Tests on FPGA-based platforms further confirm cross-platform flexibility, delivering high performance and enhanced sparsity. By enhancing information flow and rethinking SNN-ANN integration, ${SpikePack}$ advances efficient SNN deployment across diverse hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient control in long-horizon robotic manipulation is challenging due to complex representation and policy learning requirements. Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) [Liu and Wang, 2016] performs approximate Bayesian inference by representing the posterior with a set of particles. However, SVGD suffers from variance collapse, i.e. poor predictions due to underestimating uncertainty [Ba et al., 2021], even for moderately-dimensional models such as small Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). To address this issue, we generalize SVGD by letting each particle parameterize a component distribution in a mixture model. Our method, Stein Mixture Inference (SMI), optimizes a lower bound to the evidence (ELBO) and introduces user-specified guides parameterized by particles. SMI extends the Nonlinear SVGD framework [Wang and Liu, 2019] to the case of variational Bayes. SMI effectively avoids variance collapse, judging by a previously described test developed for this purpose, and performs well on standard data sets. In addition, SMI requires considerably fewer particles than SVGD to accurately estimate uncertainty for small BNNs. The synergistic combination of NSVGD, ELBO optimization and user-specified guides establishes a promising approach towards variational Bayesian inference in the case of tall and wide data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As software systems grow more complex, automated testing has become essential to ensuring reliability and performance. Traditional methods for boundary value test input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all potential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or highly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test inputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through prompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based test input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage, comparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional boundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and limitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting common boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain areas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This research provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing, underscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated testing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods are standard tools for inferring parameters of complex models when the likelihood function is analytically intractable. A popular approach to improving the poor acceptance rate of the basic rejection sampling ABC algorithm is to use sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) to produce a sequence of proposal distributions adapting towards the posterior, instead of generating values from the prior distribution of the model parameters. Proposal distribution for the subsequent iteration is typically obtained from a weighted set of samples, often called particles, of the current iteration of this sequence. Current methods for constructing these proposal distributions treat all the particles equivalently, regardless of the corresponding value generated by the sampler, which may lead to inefficiency when propagating the information across iterations of the algorithm. To improve sampler efficiency, we introduce a modified approach called stratified distance ABC SMC. Our algorithm stratifies particles based on their distance between the corresponding synthetic and observed data, and then constructs distinct proposal distributions for all the strata. Taking into account the distribution of distances across the particle space leads to substantially improved acceptance rate of the rejection sampling. We further show that efficiency can be gained by introducing a novel stopping rule for the sequential process based on the stratified posterior samples and demonstrate these advances by several examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study is aimed at identifying possible low-mass and sub-stellar companions to stars with well-determined metallicities. We investigate the multiplicity of metal-poor stars along with its impact on formation processes in the conditions of the early universe. Our goal is to look for wide common proper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency at low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and WISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of Gaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky. We combined the Gaia sample with other public catalogues and spectroscopic determinations for a given subsample to refine the stellar metallicities. We also considered other public catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We obtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging technique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610 metal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred a multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected separations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any other limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum binary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of metallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is relatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected separations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of metal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly lower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case. We interpret these similarities and differences as being due to the chemistry at work in molecular clouds as well as disruption effects attributed to the old age of subdwarfs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, posing challenges for their safe deployment. Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Owing to their significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency and especially speed, optical neuromorphic systems have arisen as interesting alternatives to conventional semiconductor devices. Recently, photonic crystal nanolasers with excitable behaviour were first demonstrated. Depending on the pumping strength, they emit short optical pulses -- spikes -- at various intervals on a nanosecond timescale. In this theoretical work, we show how networks of such photonic spiking neurons can be used for Bayesian inference through sampling from learned probability distributions. We provide a detailed derivation of translation rules from conventional sampling networks such as Boltzmann machines to photonic spiking networks and demonstrate their functionality across a range of generative tasks. Finally, we provide estimates of processing speed and power consumption, for which we expect improvements of several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art neuromorphic systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the identification and classification of static and dynamic human activities, which find applicability in domains like healthcare, entertainment, security, and cyber-physical systems. Traditional HAR approaches rely on wearable sensors, vision-based systems, or ambient sensing, each with inherent limitations such as privacy concerns or restricted sensing conditions. Recently, Radio Frequency (RF)-based HAR has emerged, relying on the interaction of RF signals with people to infer activities. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) offers significant potential in this domain by enabling dynamic control over the wireless environment, thus enhancing the information extracted from RF signals. We present an Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) approach that employs our own 6.5 GHz RIS design to manipulate the RF medium in an area of interest. We validate the capability of our RIS to control the medium by characterizing its steering response, and further we gather and publish a dataset for HGR classification for three different hand gestures. By employing two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models trained on data gathered under random and optimized RIS configuration sequences, we achieved classification accuracies exceeding 90%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces DeepFlow, a scalable and serverless AI platform designed to efficiently serve large language models (LLMs) at scale in cloud environments. DeepFlow addresses key challenges such as resource allocation, serving efficiency, and cold start latencies through four main design components. First, it uses a simple serverless abstraction called the request-job-task model, which helps manage AI workloads across post-training and model serving tasks. Second, it builds an in-house serving engine FlowServe using a microkernel-inspired design, NPU-centric execution, and SPMD-based parallelism to optimize LLM serving. The system also includes novel scheduling policies tailored for both PD-disaggregated and PD-colocated configurations. With optimizations like pre-warmed pods, DRAM pre-loading, and NPU-fork, DeepFlow can scale up to 64 instances in seconds. DeepFlow has been in production for over a year, operating on a large Ascend NPU cluster and providing industrystandard APIs for fine-tuning, agent serving, and model serving to our customers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The accurate detection and segmentation of pavement distresses, particularly tiny and small cracks, are critical for early intervention and preventive maintenance in transportation infrastructure. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive and inconsistent, while existing deep learning models struggle with fine-grained segmentation and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this study proposes Context-CrackNet, a novel encoder-decoder architecture featuring the Region-Focused Enhancement Module (RFEM) and Context-Aware Global Module (CAGM). These innovations enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local details and global contextual dependencies, respectively. Context-CrackNet was rigorously evaluated on ten publicly available crack segmentation datasets, covering diverse pavement distress scenarios. The model consistently outperformed 9 state-of-the-art segmentation frameworks, achieving superior performance metrics such as mIoU and Dice score, while maintaining competitive inference efficiency. Ablation studies confirmed the complementary roles of RFEM and CAGM, with notable improvements in mIoU and Dice score when both modules were integrated. Additionally, the model's balance of precision and computational efficiency highlights its potential for real-time deployment in large-scale pavement monitoring systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous value prediction (CVP) plays a crucial role in short video recommendation, capturing user preferences through precise numerical estimations. However, traditional regression-based methods often struggle with challenges like wide value ranges and imbalanced data, leading to prediction bias. While ordinal classification approaches have been introduced to address these issues, their reliance on discretization reduces accuracy and overlooks inherent relationships between intervals. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel Generative Regression (GR) framework for CVP, inspired by sequence generation techniques in language modeling. Our method transforms numerical values into token sequences through structural discretization, preserving original data fidelity while improving prediction precision. Leveraging a carefully crafted vocabulary and label encoding, GR employs curriculum learning with an embedding mixup strategy to bridge training-inference gaps. Experimental evaluations on four public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset validate the superiority of GR over existing methods. Real-world A/B tests on Kuaishou, a leading video platform, further demonstrate its practical effectiveness. Additionally, GR proves adaptable to other regression tasks, such as Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for diverse CVP challenges.

In this design, a triple Wald-DID estimand, which divides the difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) estimand of the outcome by the DDD estimand of the treatment, captures the local average treatment effect on the treated. The identifying assumptions mainly comprise a monotonicity assumption, and the common acceleration assumptions in the treatment and the outcome. We extend the canonical triple DID-IV design to staggered instrument cases. We also describe the estimation and inference in this design in practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Atacama segment in Northern Chile (24{\deg}S to 31{\deg}S) is a mature seismic gap with no major event (Mw>8) since 1922. In addition to regular seismicity, around the subducting Copiap\'o ridge, the region hosts seismic swarms, and shallow and deep slow slip events. To characterize the fine structure of this seismic gap and its seismic-aseismic interplay, we instrumented the region with almost 200 seismic and geodetic stations. Using machine learning, we derived a dense, high-resolution seismicity catalog, encompassing over 165,000 events with double-difference relocated hypocenters. Our catalog details the outer rise, interface, intraslab, crustal and mantle wedge seismicity. We infer a detailed slab geometry, showing that the flat slab is dipping towards the south with a narrower extent along dip. The slab geometry controls the intraslab seismicity, with cross-cutting activity in the region of highest bending and a downdip limit around 105 km slab depth. Our catalogue exhibits significant seismicity in the mantle wedge upper corner between 28{\deg}S and 31{\deg}S, highlighting the brittle behavior of the cold nose. On the subduction interface, interplate locking controls the updip end of the seismicity, with seismicity extending closer to the trench in low-locking areas. On fine scales, resolved by relative uncertainties below 50 m, the subduction interface has a complex 3D structure, showing a fractal distribution of seismic patches down to a scale of tens of meters. Our results provide a holistic view of this complex subduction zone, while at the same time giving insights into fine-scale structures and processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep extreme classification (XC) aims to train an encoder architecture and an accompanying classifier architecture to tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a very large universe of labels. XC applications in ranking, recommendation and tagging routinely encounter tail labels for which the amount of training data is exceedingly small. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) present a convenient but computationally expensive way to leverage task metadata and enhance model accuracies in these settings. This paper formally establishes that in several use cases, the steep computational cost of GCNs is entirely avoidable by replacing GCNs with non-GCN architectures. The paper notices that in these settings, it is much more effective to use graph data to regularize encoder training than to implement a GCN. Based on these insights, an alternative paradigm RAMEN is presented to utilize graph metadata in XC settings that offers significant performance boosts with zero increase in inference computational costs. RAMEN scales to datasets with up to 1M labels and offers prediction accuracy up to 15% higher on benchmark datasets than state of the art methods, including those that use graph metadata to train GCNs. RAMEN also offers 10% higher accuracy over the best baseline on a proprietary recommendation dataset sourced from click logs of a popular search engine. Code for RAMEN will be released publicly.

In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' using the late-time observables. The posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like naturally excluding physically unviable regions such as phantom crossings or exponential growth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The parity-violating asymmetry, including leading-order QED corrections to the Coulomb potential, is calculated non-perturbatively by solving the Dirac equation. At GeV collision energies and forward scattering angles, QED effects enhance the asymmetry by approximately 5% for the recently measured nuclei 27Al, 48Ca, and 208Pb. The corrections result in a shift of the estimated neutron radius, leading to an increase in the inferred neutron skin thicknesses of these nuclei and, thus, to the pressure neutrons feel around nuclear saturation density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Declines in resilience have been observed in several climate tipping elements over the past decades, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Amazon rainforest (AR). Large-scale nonlinear and possibly irreversible changes in system state, such as AMOC weakening or rainforest-savanna transitions in the Amazon basin, would have severe impacts on ecosystems and human societies worldwide. In order to improve future tipping risk assessments, understanding interactions between tipping elements is crucial. The AMOC is known to influence the Intertropical Convergence Zone, potentially altering precipitation patterns over the AR and affecting its stability. However, AMOC-AR interactions are currently not well understood. Here, we identify a previously unknown stabilising interaction pathway from the AMOC onto the Southern AR, applying an established causal discovery and inference approach to tipping element interactions for the first time. Analysing observational and reanalysis data from 1982-2022, we show that AMOC weakening leads to increased precipitation in the Southern AR during the critical dry season, in line with findings from recent Earth system model experiments. Specifically, we report a 4.8% increase of mean dry season precipitation in the Southern AR for every 1 Sv of AMOC weakening. This finding is consistent across multiple data sources and AMOC strength indices. We show that this stabilising interaction has offset 17% of dry season precipitation decrease in the Southern AR since 1982. Our results demonstrate the potential of causal discovery methods for analysing tipping element interactions based on reanalysis and observational data. By improving the understanding of AMOC-AR interactions, we contribute toward better constraining the risk of potential climate tipping cascades under global warming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this letter we argue that the CPL parameterisation for the dark energy equation of state is biased towards preferring such model over the constant $w$ while the latter bounds are still compatible with LCDM. For that we compare constraints on the EoS parameters $w_0$ and early time type $w_a$ (CPL) against those with a late time parameterisation on $w_a$ (LZ) and the constant $w$ model, using CMB, Supernovae and BAO from DESI datasets. We found, the same as was the case with CPL model, preference for dynamical dark energy within the LZ model, but for values almost symmetrically distributed with respect to their LCDM limits. This is due to the fact that the presence of $w_0$ allows to recast each parametrisation into making it compensate the preference for $w\sim -1$ in the opposite direction. To further test our hypothesis, we fixed $w_0$ to -1 and followed a minimal approach by considering models that deviates by one free parameter, or we extend to more general models that either group both late and early effects, or allow the presence of two dark energy fluid alike and constant alike component. We found that all the variants, except the original CPL are still compatible with LCDM, with likelihoods peaking close to $w_0 = -1$, $w_a = 0$, or 0.68 for $\Omega_{\rm CC}$, with the constant $w$ and the late time $w_a$ having the smallest constraints. Although we found that the evidence from CPL is stronger than those for the more minimal cases, however the preference increases further for the more generalized parameterizations, while still staying compatible with LCDM in terms of the significance levels. We conclude that considering CPL model is not sufficient to test deviation from the standard model and that it is necessary to conduct further minimal or more general approaches to better understand the outcomes from model testing and inference methods.(abridged)

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Normalizing Flows (NFs) are powerful and efficient models for density estimation. When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for star-like manifolds and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. This aspect is particularly relevant for variational inference settings, where no samples are available and only some unnormalized target is known. Among many, we showcase the relevance of modeling densities on star-like manifolds in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach for penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider probabilistic mixing models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video-based human pose estimation has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling through the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies. However, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to models that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging scenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good interpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on pose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework, consisting of two stages. \textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the model with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two self-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable the network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint information, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and making it robust to challenging scenes. \textit{In the second stage}, we argue that not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing causal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which could improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a Token Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and non-causal tokens (\textit{e.g.}, background and objects). Additionally, non-causal tokens could provide potentially beneficial cues but may be redundant. We further introduce a non-causal tokens clustering module to merge the similar non-causal tokens. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmark datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper revisits the online learning approach to inverse linear optimization studied by B\"armann et al. (2017), where the goal is to infer an unknown linear objective function of an agent from sequential observations of the agent's input-output pairs. First, we provide a simple understanding of the online learning approach through its connection to online convex optimization of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. As a byproduct, we present an offline guarantee on the \emph{suboptimality loss}, which measures how well predicted objectives explain the agent's choices, without assuming the optimality of the agent's choices. Second, assuming that there is a gap between optimal and suboptimal objective values in the agent's decision problems, we obtain an upper bound independent of the time horizon $T$ on the sum of suboptimality and \emph{estimate losses}, where the latter measures the quality of solutions recommended by predicted objectives. Interestingly, our gap-dependent analysis achieves a faster rate than the standard $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound by exploiting structures specific to inverse linear optimization, even though neither the loss functions nor their domains enjoy desirable properties, such as strong convexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present FireRedASR, a family of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for Mandarin, designed to meet diverse requirements in superior performance and optimal efficiency across various applications. FireRedASR comprises two variants:   FireRedASR-LLM: Designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and to enable seamless end-to-end speech interaction. It adopts an Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-LLM (8.3B parameters) achieves an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.05%, surpassing the latest SOTA of 3.33% with an 8.4% relative CER reduction (CERR). It demonstrates superior generalization capability over industrial-grade baselines, achieving 24%-40% CERR in multi-source Mandarin ASR scenarios such as video, live, and intelligent assistant.   FireRedASR-AED: Designed to balance high performance and computational efficiency and to serve as an effective speech representation module in LLM-based speech models. It utilizes an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) architecture. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-AED (1.1B parameters) achieves an average CER of 3.18%, slightly worse than FireRedASR-LLM but still outperforming the latest SOTA model with over 12B parameters. It offers a more compact size, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.   Moreover, both models exhibit competitive results on Chinese dialects and English speech benchmarks and excel in singing lyrics recognition. To advance research in speech processing, we release our models and inference code at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRedASR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.   The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.   We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs. Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy. Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria. Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| < 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| < 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for source code. Deep learning has been used more and more recently in software engineering, particularly for tasks like code creation and summarization. Specifically, it appears that the most current Large Language Models with coding perform well on these tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of code summarization, providing sophisticated methods for generating concise and accurate summaries of source code. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of several open-source LLMs, namely LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Gemma. These models' performance is assessed using important metrics such as BLEU\textsubscript{3.1} and ROUGE\textsubscript{3.2}.   Through this analysis, we seek to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in code summarization tasks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs, supporting their integration into tools that enhance software development and maintenance processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High annotation costs from hiring or crowdsourcing complicate the creation of large, high-quality datasets needed for training reliable text classifiers. Recent research suggests using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the annotation process, reducing these costs while maintaining data quality. LLMs have shown promising results in annotating downstream tasks like hate speech detection and political framing. Building on the success in these areas, this study investigates whether LLMs are viable for annotating the complex task of media bias detection and whether a downstream media bias classifier can be trained on such data. We create annolexical, the first large-scale dataset for media bias classification with over 48000 synthetically annotated examples. Our classifier, fine-tuned on this dataset, surpasses all of the annotator LLMs by 5-9 percent in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and performs close to or outperforms the model trained on human-labeled data when evaluated on two media bias benchmark datasets (BABE and BASIL). This study demonstrates how our approach significantly reduces the cost of dataset creation in the media bias domain and, by extension, the development of classifiers, while our subsequent behavioral stress-testing reveals some of its current limitations and trade-offs.

  Concurrent Programs across Memory Models</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study a setting where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) predicts the real-time value of a target signal using data samples transmitted from a remote source according to a scheduling policy. The scheduler decides on i) the age of the samples to be sent, ii) when to send them, and iii) the length of each packet (i.e., the number of samples contained in each packet). The dependence of inference quality on the Age of Information (AoI) for a given packet length is modeled by a general relationship. Previous work assumed i.i.d. transmission delays with immediate feedback or were restricted to the case where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. Our formulation, in addition to capturing non-monotone age dependence, also covers Markovian delay on both forward and feedback links. We model this as an infinite-horizon average-cost Semi-Markov Decision Process. We obtain a closed-form solution that decides on (i) and (ii) for any constant packet length. The solution for when to send is an index-based threshold policy, where the index function is expressed in terms of the delay state and AoI at the receiver. The age of the packet selected is a function of the delay state. We separately optimize the value of the constant length. We also develop an index-based threshold policy for the variable length case, which allows a complexity reduction. In simulation results, we observe that our goal-oriented scheduler drops inference error down to one sixth with respect to age-based scheduling of unit-length packets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the capabilities of large models, particularly in handling complex tasks that small-scale models are unable to perform. Notably, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated ``intelligent'' abilities such as complex reasoning and abstract language comprehension, reflecting cognitive-like behaviors. However, current research on emergent abilities in large models predominantly focuses on the relationship between model performance and size, leaving a significant gap in the systematic quantitative analysis of the internal structures and mechanisms driving these emergent abilities. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research on brain network structure and self-organization, we propose (i) a general network representation of large models, (ii) a new analytical framework, called Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA), for structural analysis, and (iii) a novel structure-based metric as a proxy for emergent abilities of large models. By linking structural features to the capabilities of large models, NeuroMFA provides a quantitative framework for analyzing emergent phenomena in large models. Our experiments show that the proposed method yields a comprehensive measure of network's evolving heterogeneity and organization, offering theoretical foundations and a new perspective for investigating emergent abilities in large models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces out-of-domain (OOD) degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhanced OOD robustness stems from a reduced prevalence of high perplexity tokens in LLM-generated sequences. Following this hypothesis we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data also achieves similar OOD preservation comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, including Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B, corroborate the consistency of our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first mechanistic explanation for the superior OOD robustness conferred by LLM-generated training data, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.   This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to identify unseen state-object compositions by leveraging knowledge learned from seen compositions. Existing approaches often independently predict states and objects, overlooking their relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, learning primitive relations (LPR), designed to probabilistically capture the relationships between states and objects. By employing the cross-attention mechanism, LPR considers the dependencies between states and objects, enabling the model to infer the likelihood of unseen compositions. Experimental results demonstrate that LPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all three CZSL benchmark datasets in both closed-world and open-world settings. Through qualitative analysis, we show that LPR leverages state-object relationships for unseen composition prediction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automated grading has become an essential tool in education technology due to its ability to efficiently assess large volumes of student work, provide consistent and unbiased evaluations, and deliver immediate feedback to enhance learning. However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advances in data acquisition and numerical wave simulation have improved tomographic imaging techniques and results, but non-experts may find it difficult to understand which model is best for their needs. This paper is intended for these users. We argue that our notion of best is influenced by the extent to which models satisfy our biases. We explain how the basic types of seismic waves see Earth structure, illustrate the essential strategy of seismic tomography, discuss advanced adaptations such as full-waveform inversion, and emphasize the artistic components of tomography. The compounding effect of a plethora of reasonable, yet subjective choices is a range of models that differ more than their individual uncertainty analyses may suggest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we argue producing similar tomographic models should not be the goal of seismic tomography. Instead, we promote a Community Monte Carlo effort to assemble a range of dissimilar models based on different modeling approaches and subjective choices, but which explain the seismic data. This effort could serve as input for geodynamic inferences with meaningful seismic uncertainties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) is a novel paradigm that takes the naive RAG system a step further by integrating graph information, such as knowledge graph (KGs), into large-scale language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucination. However, existing GRAG still encounter limitations: 1) simple paradigms usually fail with the complex problems due to the narrow and shallow correlations capture from KGs 2) methods of strong coupling with KGs tend to be high computation cost and time consuming if the graph is dense. In this paper, we propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for enabling LLMs to think ``community by community" within KGs. To do this, FastToG employs community detection for deeper correlation capture and two stages community pruning - coarse and fine pruning for faster retrieval. Furthermore, we also develop two Community-to-Text methods to convert the graph structure of communities into textual form for better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FastToG, showcasing higher accuracy, faster reasoning, and better explainability compared to the previous works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The effectiveness of search systems is evaluated using relevance labels that indicate the usefulness of documents for specific queries and users. While obtaining these relevance labels from real users is ideal, scaling such data collection is challenging. Consequently, third-party annotators are employed, but their inconsistent accuracy demands costly auditing, training, and monitoring. We propose an LLM-based modular classification pipeline that divides the relevance assessment task into multiple stages, each utilising different prompts and models of varying sizes and capabilities. Applied to TREC Deep Learning (TREC-DL), one of our approaches showed an 18.4% Krippendorff's $\alpha$ accuracy increase over OpenAI's GPT-4o mini while maintaining a cost of about 0.2 USD per million input tokens, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for relevance assessment. This approach beats the baseline performance of GPT-4o (5 USD). With a pipeline approach, even the accuracy of the GPT-4o flagship model, measured in $\alpha$, could be improved by 9.7%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D point clouds directly collected from objects through sensors are often incomplete due to self-occlusion. Conventional methods for completing these partial point clouds rely on manually organized training sets and are usually limited to object categories seen during training. In this work, we propose a test-time framework for completing partial point clouds across unseen categories without any requirement for training. Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Partial Gaussian Initialization, Zero-shot Fractal Completion, and Point Cloud Extraction that utilize priors from pre-trained 2D diffusion models to infer missing regions and extract uniform completed point clouds. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.   Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts exhibit recognition errors and various spoken language phenomena such as disfluencies, ungrammatical sentences, and incomplete sentences, hence suffering from poor readability. To improve readability, we propose a Contextualized Spoken-to-Written conversion (CoS2W) task to address ASR and grammar errors and also transfer the informal text into the formal style with content preserved, utilizing contexts and auxiliary information. This task naturally matches the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate comprehensive comparisons of various LLMs, we construct a document-level Spoken-to-Written conversion of ASR Transcripts Benchmark (SWAB) dataset. Using SWAB, we study the impact of different granularity levels on the CoS2W performance, and propose methods to exploit contexts and auxiliary information to enhance the outputs. Experimental results reveal that LLMs have the potential to excel in the CoS2W task, particularly in grammaticality and formality, our methods achieve effective understanding of contexts and auxiliary information by LLMs. We further investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators and find that LLM evaluators show strong correlations with human evaluations on rankings of faithfulness and formality, which validates the reliability of LLM evaluators for the CoS2W task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Estimating depth from a single 2D image is a challenging task due to the lack of stereo or multi-view data, which are typically required for depth perception. In state-of-the-art architectures, the main challenge is to efficiently capture complex objects and fine-grained details, which are often difficult to predict. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach using an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, where the Inception-ResNet-v2 model serves as the encoder. This is the first instance of utilizing Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation, demonstrating improved performance over previous models. It incorporates multi-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across various object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function comprising depth loss, gradient edge loss, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, with fine-tuned weights to optimize the weighted sum, ensuring a balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our model achieves a significantly faster inference time of 0.019 seconds, outperforming vision transformers in efficiency while maintaining good accuracy. On the NYU Depth V2 dataset, the model establishes state-of-the-art performance, with an Absolute Relative Error (ARE) of 0.064, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228, and an accuracy of 89.3% for $\delta$ < 1.25. These metrics demonstrate that our model can accurately and efficiently predict depth even in challenging scenarios, providing a practical solution for real-time applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-consistency (SC), a widely used decoding strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning, shows significant gains across various multi-step reasoning tasks but comes with a high cost due to multiple sampling with the preset size. Its variants, Adaptive self-consistency (ASC) and Early-stopping self-consistency (ESC), dynamically adjust the number of samples based on the posterior distribution of a set of pre-samples, reducing the cost of SC with minimal impact on performance. Both methods, however, do not exploit the prior information about question difficulty. It often results in unnecessary repeated sampling for easy questions that could be accurately answered with just one attempt, wasting resources. To tackle this problem, we propose Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC), which leverages the difficulty information from both prior and posterior perspectives to adaptively allocate inference resources, further reducing the cost of SC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DSC, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning on six benchmarks. The empirical results show that DSC consistently surpasses the strong baseline ASC and ESC in terms of costs by a significant margin, while attaining comparable performances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) Human-like cognitive abilities have emerged in advanced LLMs (GPT-4), comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scheme of adaptation via meta-learning is seen as an ingredient for solving the problem of data shortage or distribution shift in real-world applications, but it also brings the new risk of inappropriate updates of the model in the user environment, which increases the demand for explainability. Among the various types of XAI methods, establishing a method of explanation based on past experience in meta-learning requires special consideration due to its bi-level structure of training, which has been left unexplored. In this work, we propose influence functions for explaining meta-learning that measure the sensitivities of training tasks to adaptation and inference. We also argue that the approximation of the Hessian using the Gauss-Newton matrix resolves computational barriers peculiar to meta-learning. We demonstrate the adequacy of the method through experiments on task distinction and task distribution distinction using image classification tasks with MAML and Prototypical Network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%. The model and code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMD0311/HERMES.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs are increasingly deployed in global applications, the importance of cultural sensitivity becomes paramount, ensuring that users from diverse backgrounds feel respected and understood. Cultural harm can arise when these models fail to align with specific cultural norms, resulting in misrepresentations or violations of cultural values. This work addresses the challenges of ensuring cultural sensitivity in LLMs, especially in small-parameter models that often lack the extensive training data needed to capture global cultural nuances. We present two key contributions: (1) A cultural harm test dataset, created to assess model outputs across different cultural contexts through scenarios that expose potential cultural insensitivities, and (2) A culturally aligned preference dataset, aimed at restoring cultural sensitivity through fine-tuning based on feedback from diverse annotators. These datasets facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of LLMs, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment across different cultural landscapes. Our results show that integrating culturally aligned feedback leads to a marked improvement in model behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating culturally insensitive or harmful content. Ultimately, this work paves the way for more inclusive and respectful AI systems, fostering a future where LLMs can safely and ethically navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare. In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in natural language processing have leveraged instruction tuning to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, previous works train different base models with different training data, lacking an apples-to-apples comparison across the result table LLMs. To address this, we fine-tune base models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families on existing public training datasets. Our replication achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing table LLMs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on Hitab, a table question-answering dataset. More importantly, through systematic out-of-domain evaluation, we decouple the contributions of training data and the base model, providing insight into their individual impacts. In addition, we assess the effects of table-specific instruction tuning on general-purpose benchmarks, revealing trade-offs between specialization and generalization.

We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a central topic in the study of artificial intelligence. This new domain necessitates the creation of datasets of reasoning tasks for both training and benchmarking the performance of LLMs. To this end, we introduce the Karp dataset: The first dataset composed of detailed proofs of NP-completeness reductions. The reductions vary in difficulty, ranging from simple exercises of undergraduate courses to more challenging reductions from academic papers. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art models on this task and demonstrate the effect of fine-tuning with the Karp dataset on reasoning capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To achieve generalized and robust natural-to-formal language conversion (N2F), large language models (LLMs) need to have strong capabilities of decomposition and composition in N2F when faced with an unfamiliar formal language and be able to cope with compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names. To investigate whether LLMs have this set of basic capabilities in N2F, we propose the DEDC framework. This framework semi-automatically performs sample and task construction, allowing decoupled evaluation of the set of decomposition and composition capabilities of LLMs in N2F. Based on this framework, we evaluate and analyze the most advanced LLMs, and the main findings include that: (1) the LLMs are deficient in both decomposition and composition; (2) the LLMs show a wide coverage of error types that can be attributed to deficiencies in natural language understanding and the learning and use of symbolic systems; (3) compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names both affect the decomposition and composition of the LLMs. Our work provides a new perspective for investigating the basic capabilities of decomposition and composition of LLMs in N2F. The detailed analysis of deficiencies and attributions can help subsequent improvements of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Citizen reporting platforms like Safe City in India help the public and authorities stay informed about sexual harassment incidents. However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice.   We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is often hindered by the disconnect between the needs of domain experts and translating these needs into robust and valid ML tools. Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.

Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs), pose significant challenges to upholding academic integrity in higher education. This paper investigates the susceptibility of a Master's-level cyber security degree program at a UK Russell Group university, accredited by a leading national body, to LLM misuse. Through the application and extension of a quantitative assessment framework, we identify a high exposure to misuse, particularly in independent project- and report-based assessments. Contributing factors, including block teaching and a predominantly international cohort, are highlighted as potential amplifiers of these vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, we discuss the adoption of LLM-resistant assessments, detection tools, and the importance of fostering an ethical learning environment. These approaches aim to uphold academic standards while preparing students for the complexities of real-world cyber security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

Although LLMs were originally designed for natural language understanding, their adaptability to multimodal tasks, including geospatial analysis, has opened new frontiers in data-driven research. By leveraging advancements in vision-enabled LLMs, we assess their ability to provide interpretable, scalable, and reliable insights into human poverty from satellite images. Using a pairwise comparison approach, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can rank satellite images based on poverty levels with accuracy comparable to domain experts. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of LLMs in socioeconomic research, providing a foundation for their integration into poverty assessment workflows. This study contributes to the ongoing exploration of unconventional data sources for welfare analysis and opens pathways for cost-effective, large-scale poverty monitoring.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural networks have become a fundamental component of numerous practical applications, and their implementations, which are often accelerated by hardware, are integrated into all types of real-world physical devices. User interactions with neural networks on hardware accelerators are commonly considered privacy-sensitive. Substantial efforts have been made to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance privacy protection at the level of machine learning algorithms, including membership inference attacks, differential privacy, and federated learning. However, neural networks are ultimately implemented and deployed on physical devices, and current research pays comparatively less attention to privacy protection at the implementation level. In this paper, we introduce a generic physical side-channel attack, ScaAR, that extracts user interactions with neural networks by leveraging electromagnetic (EM) emissions of physical devices. Our proposed attack is implementation-agnostic, meaning it does not require the adversary to possess detailed knowledge of the hardware or software implementations, thanks to the capabilities of deep learning-based side-channel analysis (DLSCA). Experimental results demonstrate that, through the EM side channel, ScaAR can effectively extract the class label of user interactions with neural classifiers, including inputs and outputs, on the AMD-Xilinx MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA and Raspberry Pi 3 B. In addition, for the first time, we provide side-channel analysis on edge Large Language Model (LLM) implementations on the Raspberry Pi 5, showing that EM side channel leaks interaction data, and different LLM tokens can be distinguishable from the EM traces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.

To address these challenges, we propose ResoFilter, a novel method that integrates models, data, and tasks to refine datasets. ResoFilter leverages the fine-tuning process to obtain Data-Parameter features for data selection, offering improved interpretability by representing data characteristics through model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that ResoFilter achieves comparable results to full-scale fine-tuning using only half the data in mathematical tasks and exhibits strong generalization across different models and domains. This method provides valuable insights for constructing synthetic datasets and evaluating high-quality data, offering a promising solution for enhancing data augmentation techniques and improving training dataset quality for LLMs. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential across various tasks. However, research for exploring and improving the capabilities of LLMs in interpreting graph structures remains limited. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompting current open-source LLMs on graph-to-text generation tasks. Although we explored the optimal prompting strategies and proposed a novel and effective diversity-difficulty-based few-shot sample selection method, we found that the improvements from tuning-free approaches were incremental, as LLMs struggle with planning on complex graphs, particularly those with a larger number of triplets. To further improve LLMs in planning with graph sequences and grounding in truth, we introduce a new graph-to-text dataset, PlanGTG, annotated with two sub-tasks: reordering and attribution. Through extensive automatic and human evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of generated text from both few-shot learning and fine-tuning perspectives using the PlanGTG dataset. Our study paves the way for new research directions in graph-to-text generation. PlanGTG datasets can be found in https://github.com/probe2/kg_text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) hold promise for energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing. We identify substantial informatio loss during spike transmission, linked to temporal dependencies in traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron-a key factor potentially limiting SNN performance. Existing SNN architectures also underutilize modern GPUs, constrained by single-bit spike storage and isolated weight-spike operations that restrict computational efficiency. We introduce ${SpikePack}$, a neuron model designed to reduce transmission loss while preserving essential features like membrane potential reset and leaky integration. ${SpikePack}$ achieves constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexity, enabling efficient parallel processing on GPUs and also supporting serial inference on existing SNN hardware accelerators. Compatible with standard Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, ${SpikePack}$ facilitates near-lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion across various networks. Experimental results on tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation show ${SpikePack}$ achieves significant gains in accuracy and efficiency for both directly trained and converted SNNs over state-of-the-art models. Tests on FPGA-based platforms further confirm cross-platform flexibility, delivering high performance and enhanced sparsity. By enhancing information flow and rethinking SNN-ANN integration, ${SpikePack}$ advances efficient SNN deployment across diverse hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient control in long-horizon robotic manipulation is challenging due to complex representation and policy learning requirements. Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent rehearsal-free methods, guided by prompts, generally excel in vision-related continual learning (CL) scenarios with continuously drifting data. To be deployable on real-world devices, these methods must contain high resource efficiency during training. In this paper, we introduce Resource-Efficient Prompting (REP), which targets improving the resource efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free methods. Our key focus is on avoiding catastrophic trade-offs with accuracy while trimming computational and memory costs during prompt learning. We achieve this by exploiting swift prompt selection that enhances input data using a carefully provisioned model, and by developing adaptive token merging (AToM) and layer dropping (ALD) algorithms for the prompt updating stage. AToM and ALD perform selective skipping across the data and model dimensions without compromising task-specific features while learning new tasks. We validate REP's superior resource efficiency over current state-of-the-art ViT- and CNN-based methods through extensive experiments on three image classification datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As software systems grow more complex, automated testing has become essential to ensuring reliability and performance. Traditional methods for boundary value test input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all potential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or highly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test inputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through prompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based test input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage, comparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional boundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and limitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting common boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain areas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This research provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing, underscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated testing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, posing challenges for their safe deployment. Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of deep neural networks has spawned the rapid development of acoustic echo cancellation and noise suppression, and plenty of prior arts have been proposed, which yield promising performance. Nevertheless, they rarely consider the deployment generality in different processing scenarios, such as edge devices, and cloud processing. To this end, this paper proposes a general model, termed SMRU, to cover different application scenarios. The novelty lies in two-fold. First, a multi-scale band split layer and band merge layer are proposed to effectively fuse local frequency bands for lower complexity modeling. Besides, by simulating the multi-resolution feature modeling characteristic of the classical UNet structure, a novel recurrent-dominated UNet is devised. It consists of multiple variable frame rate blocks, each of which involves the causal time down-/up-sampling layer with varying compression ratios and the dual-path structure for inter- and intra-band modeling. The model is configured from 50 M/s to 6.8 G/s in terms of MACs, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach yields competitive or even better performance over existing baselines, and has the full potential to adapt to more general scenarios with varying complexity requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are safety-critical, as real-world safety violations can result in significant losses. Rigorous testing is essential before deployment, with simulation testing playing a key role. However, ADSs are typically complex, consisting of multiple modules such as perception and planning, or well-trained end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Offline methods, such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), can only generate predefined trajectories for dynamics, which struggle to cause safety violations for ADSs rapidly and efficiently in different scenarios due to their evolutionary nature. Online methods, such as single-agent reinforcement learning (RL), can quickly adjust the dynamics' trajectory online to adapt to different scenarios, but they struggle to capture complex corner cases of ADS arising from the intricate interplay among multiple vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has a strong ability in cooperative tasks. On the other hand, it faces its own challenges, particularly with convergence. This paper introduces MARL-OT, a scalable framework that leverages MARL to detect safety violations of ADS resulting from surrounding vehicles' cooperation. MARL-OT employs MARL for high-level guidance, triggering various dangerous scenarios for the rule-based online fuzzer to explore potential safety violations of ADS, thereby generating dynamic, realistic safety violation scenarios. Our approach improves the detected safety violation rate by up to 136.2% compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) testing technique.

This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laypeople -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.   To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces DeepFlow, a scalable and serverless AI platform designed to efficiently serve large language models (LLMs) at scale in cloud environments. DeepFlow addresses key challenges such as resource allocation, serving efficiency, and cold start latencies through four main design components. First, it uses a simple serverless abstraction called the request-job-task model, which helps manage AI workloads across post-training and model serving tasks. Second, it builds an in-house serving engine FlowServe using a microkernel-inspired design, NPU-centric execution, and SPMD-based parallelism to optimize LLM serving. The system also includes novel scheduling policies tailored for both PD-disaggregated and PD-colocated configurations. With optimizations like pre-warmed pods, DRAM pre-loading, and NPU-fork, DeepFlow can scale up to 64 instances in seconds. DeepFlow has been in production for over a year, operating on a large Ascend NPU cluster and providing industrystandard APIs for fine-tuning, agent serving, and model serving to our customers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The accurate detection and segmentation of pavement distresses, particularly tiny and small cracks, are critical for early intervention and preventive maintenance in transportation infrastructure. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive and inconsistent, while existing deep learning models struggle with fine-grained segmentation and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this study proposes Context-CrackNet, a novel encoder-decoder architecture featuring the Region-Focused Enhancement Module (RFEM) and Context-Aware Global Module (CAGM). These innovations enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained local details and global contextual dependencies, respectively. Context-CrackNet was rigorously evaluated on ten publicly available crack segmentation datasets, covering diverse pavement distress scenarios. The model consistently outperformed 9 state-of-the-art segmentation frameworks, achieving superior performance metrics such as mIoU and Dice score, while maintaining competitive inference efficiency. Ablation studies confirmed the complementary roles of RFEM and CAGM, with notable improvements in mIoU and Dice score when both modules were integrated. Additionally, the model's balance of precision and computational efficiency highlights its potential for real-time deployment in large-scale pavement monitoring systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To support the growing demand for data-intensive and low-latency IoT applications, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as an effective edge-computing approach enabling the execution of delay-sensitive processing tasks close to end-users. However, most of the existing works on resource allocation and service placement in MEC systems overlook the unique characteristics of new IoT use cases. For instance, many IoT applications require the periodic execution of computing tasks on real-time data streams that originate from devices dispersed over a wide area. Thus, users requesting IoT services are typically distant from the data producers. To fill this gap, the contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a MEC-compliant architectural solution to support the operation of multiple IoT service providers over a common MEC platform deployment, which enables the steering and shaping of IoT data transport within the platform. Secondly, we model the problem of service placement and data management in the proposed MEC-based solution taking into account the dependencies at the data level between IoT services and sensing resources. Our model also considers that caches can be deployed on MEC hosts, to allow the sharing of the same data between different IoT services with overlapping geographical scope, and provides support for IoT services with heterogeneous QoS requirements, such as different frequencies of periodic task execution. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed using linear relaxation and rounding techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, especially when traffic demands generated by the service requests are not uniform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents. Codes and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/ArthurLeoM/DRESS-LLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present FireRedASR, a family of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for Mandarin, designed to meet diverse requirements in superior performance and optimal efficiency across various applications. FireRedASR comprises two variants:   FireRedASR-LLM: Designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and to enable seamless end-to-end speech interaction. It adopts an Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-LLM (8.3B parameters) achieves an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.05%, surpassing the latest SOTA of 3.33% with an 8.4% relative CER reduction (CERR). It demonstrates superior generalization capability over industrial-grade baselines, achieving 24%-40% CERR in multi-source Mandarin ASR scenarios such as video, live, and intelligent assistant.   FireRedASR-AED: Designed to balance high performance and computational efficiency and to serve as an effective speech representation module in LLM-based speech models. It utilizes an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) architecture. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-AED (1.1B parameters) achieves an average CER of 3.18%, slightly worse than FireRedASR-LLM but still outperforming the latest SOTA model with over 12B parameters. It offers a more compact size, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.   Moreover, both models exhibit competitive results on Chinese dialects and English speech benchmarks and excel in singing lyrics recognition. To advance research in speech processing, we release our models and inference code at https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRedASR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse distributions of seismic sensors and sources pose challenges for subsurface imaging, source characterization, and ground motion modeling. While large-N arrays have shown the potential of dense observational data, their deployment over extensive areas is constrained by economic and logistical limitations. Numerical simulations offer an alternative, but modeling realistic wavefields remains computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we develop a multi-conditional diffusion transformer for generating seismic wavefields without requiring prior geological knowledge. Our method produces high-resolution wavefields that accurately capture both amplitude and phase information across diverse source and station configurations. The model first generates amplitude spectra conditioned on input attributes and subsequently refines wavefields through iterative phase optimization. We validate our approach using data from the Geysers geothermal field, demonstrating the generation of wavefields with spatial continuity and fidelity in both spectral amplitude and phase. These synthesized wavefields hold promise for advancing structural imaging and source characterization in seismology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.   The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.   We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Keeping ML-based recommender models up-to-date as data drifts and evolves is essential to maintain accuracy. As a result, online data preprocessing plays an increasingly important role in serving recommender systems. Existing solutions employ multiple CPU workers to saturate the input bandwidth of a single training node. Such an approach results in high deployment costs and energy consumption. For instance, a recent report from industrial deployments shows that data storage and ingestion pipelines can account for over 60\% of the power consumption in a recommender system. In this paper, we tackle the issue from a hardware perspective by introducing Piper, a flexible and network-attached accelerator that executes data loading and preprocessing pipelines in a streaming fashion. As part of the design, we define MiniPipe, the smallest pipeline unit enabling multi-pipeline implementation by executing various data preprocessing tasks across the single board, giving Piper the ability to be reconfigured at runtime. Our results, using publicly released commercial pipelines, show that Piper, prototyped on a power-efficient FPGA, achieves a 39$\sim$105$\times$ speedup over a server-grade, 128-core CPU and 3$\sim$17$\times$ speedup over GPUs like RTX 3090 and A100 in multiple pipelines. The experimental analysis demonstrates that Piper provides advantages in both latency and energy efficiency for preprocessing tasks in recommender systems, providing an alternative design point for systems that today are in very high demand.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for source code. Deep learning has been used more and more recently in software engineering, particularly for tasks like code creation and summarization. Specifically, it appears that the most current Large Language Models with coding perform well on these tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of code summarization, providing sophisticated methods for generating concise and accurate summaries of source code. This study aims to perform a comparative analysis of several open-source LLMs, namely LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Gemma. These models' performance is assessed using important metrics such as BLEU\textsubscript{3.1} and ROUGE\textsubscript{3.2}.   Through this analysis, we seek to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, offering insights into their applicability and effectiveness in code summarization tasks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of LLMs, supporting their integration into tools that enhance software development and maintenance processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High annotation costs from hiring or crowdsourcing complicate the creation of large, high-quality datasets needed for training reliable text classifiers. Recent research suggests using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the annotation process, reducing these costs while maintaining data quality. LLMs have shown promising results in annotating downstream tasks like hate speech detection and political framing. Building on the success in these areas, this study investigates whether LLMs are viable for annotating the complex task of media bias detection and whether a downstream media bias classifier can be trained on such data. We create annolexical, the first large-scale dataset for media bias classification with over 48000 synthetically annotated examples. Our classifier, fine-tuned on this dataset, surpasses all of the annotator LLMs by 5-9 percent in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and performs close to or outperforms the model trained on human-labeled data when evaluated on two media bias benchmark datasets (BABE and BASIL). This study demonstrates how our approach significantly reduces the cost of dataset creation in the media bias domain and, by extension, the development of classifiers, while our subsequent behavioral stress-testing reveals some of its current limitations and trade-offs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the capabilities of large models, particularly in handling complex tasks that small-scale models are unable to perform. Notably, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated ``intelligent'' abilities such as complex reasoning and abstract language comprehension, reflecting cognitive-like behaviors. However, current research on emergent abilities in large models predominantly focuses on the relationship between model performance and size, leaving a significant gap in the systematic quantitative analysis of the internal structures and mechanisms driving these emergent abilities. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research on brain network structure and self-organization, we propose (i) a general network representation of large models, (ii) a new analytical framework, called Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA), for structural analysis, and (iii) a novel structure-based metric as a proxy for emergent abilities of large models. By linking structural features to the capabilities of large models, NeuroMFA provides a quantitative framework for analyzing emergent phenomena in large models. Our experiments show that the proposed method yields a comprehensive measure of network's evolving heterogeneity and organization, offering theoretical foundations and a new perspective for investigating emergent abilities in large models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces out-of-domain (OOD) degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhanced OOD robustness stems from a reduced prevalence of high perplexity tokens in LLM-generated sequences. Following this hypothesis we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data also achieves similar OOD preservation comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, including Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B, corroborate the consistency of our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first mechanistic explanation for the superior OOD robustness conferred by LLM-generated training data, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code debugging is a vital stage of software development, essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation task. Human debugging typically follows a multi-stage process, which includes Bug Localization, Bug Identification, Code Repair, and Code Recognition. However, existing code debugging benchmarks predominantly focus on the Code Repair stage, which offers only a limited perspective on evaluating the debugging capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the debugging abilities of LLMs by emulating the multi-stage human debugging process. Through evaluating on DEBUGEVAL, we observe that 7B-scale models consistently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, highlighting their limitations in comprehending code semantics. In this case, we propose the COmmunicative Agent-based data SynThesis (COAST) framework, which employs a multi-agent system to generate high-quality training data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that COAST-generated data outperform human-curated and GPT-4-generated data, enabling 7B-scale LLMs to achieve debugging performance comparable to GPT-3.5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.   This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automated grading has become an essential tool in education technology due to its ability to efficiently assess large volumes of student work, provide consistent and unbiased evaluations, and deliver immediate feedback to enhance learning. However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) is a novel paradigm that takes the naive RAG system a step further by integrating graph information, such as knowledge graph (KGs), into large-scale language models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucination. However, existing GRAG still encounter limitations: 1) simple paradigms usually fail with the complex problems due to the narrow and shallow correlations capture from KGs 2) methods of strong coupling with KGs tend to be high computation cost and time consuming if the graph is dense. In this paper, we propose the Fast Think-on-Graph (FastToG), an innovative paradigm for enabling LLMs to think ``community by community" within KGs. To do this, FastToG employs community detection for deeper correlation capture and two stages community pruning - coarse and fine pruning for faster retrieval. Furthermore, we also develop two Community-to-Text methods to convert the graph structure of communities into textual form for better understanding by LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FastToG, showcasing higher accuracy, faster reasoning, and better explainability compared to the previous works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The effectiveness of search systems is evaluated using relevance labels that indicate the usefulness of documents for specific queries and users. While obtaining these relevance labels from real users is ideal, scaling such data collection is challenging. Consequently, third-party annotators are employed, but their inconsistent accuracy demands costly auditing, training, and monitoring. We propose an LLM-based modular classification pipeline that divides the relevance assessment task into multiple stages, each utilising different prompts and models of varying sizes and capabilities. Applied to TREC Deep Learning (TREC-DL), one of our approaches showed an 18.4% Krippendorff's $\alpha$ accuracy increase over OpenAI's GPT-4o mini while maintaining a cost of about 0.2 USD per million input tokens, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for relevance assessment. This approach beats the baseline performance of GPT-4o (5 USD). With a pipeline approach, even the accuracy of the GPT-4o flagship model, measured in $\alpha$, could be improved by 9.7%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.   Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Temporal point processes (TPPs) are stochastic process models used to characterize event sequences occurring in continuous time. Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts exhibit recognition errors and various spoken language phenomena such as disfluencies, ungrammatical sentences, and incomplete sentences, hence suffering from poor readability. To improve readability, we propose a Contextualized Spoken-to-Written conversion (CoS2W) task to address ASR and grammar errors and also transfer the informal text into the formal style with content preserved, utilizing contexts and auxiliary information. This task naturally matches the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate comprehensive comparisons of various LLMs, we construct a document-level Spoken-to-Written conversion of ASR Transcripts Benchmark (SWAB) dataset. Using SWAB, we study the impact of different granularity levels on the CoS2W performance, and propose methods to exploit contexts and auxiliary information to enhance the outputs. Experimental results reveal that LLMs have the potential to excel in the CoS2W task, particularly in grammaticality and formality, our methods achieve effective understanding of contexts and auxiliary information by LLMs. We further investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators and find that LLM evaluators show strong correlations with human evaluations on rankings of faithfulness and formality, which validates the reliability of LLM evaluators for the CoS2W task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) Human-like cognitive abilities have emerged in advanced LLMs (GPT-4), comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in converting C code to Rust, to benefit from the memory and thread safety guarantees of Rust. C2Rust is a rule-based system that can automatically convert C code to functionally identical Rust, but the Rust code that it produces is non-idiomatic, i.e., makes extensive use of unsafe Rust, a subset of the language that doesn't have memory or thread safety guarantees. At the other end of the spectrum are LLMs, which produce idiomatic Rust code, but these have the potential to make mistakes and are constrained in the length of code they can process. In this paper, we present C2SaferRust, a novel approach to translate C to Rust that combines the strengths of C2Rust and LLMs. We first use C2Rust to convert C code to non-idiomatic, unsafe Rust. We then decompose the unsafe Rust code into slices that can be individually translated to safer Rust by an LLM. After processing each slice, we run end-to-end test cases to verify that the code still functions as expected. We also contribute a benchmark of 7 real-world programs, translated from C to unsafe Rust using C2Rust. Each of these programs also comes with end-to-end test cases. On this benchmark, we are able to reduce the number of raw pointers by up to 38%, and reduce the amount of unsafe code by up to 28%, indicating an increase in safety. The resulting programs still pass all test cases. C2SaferRust also shows convincing gains in performance against two previous techniques for making Rust code safer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph databases like Neo4j are gaining popularity for handling complex, interconnected data, over traditional relational databases in modeling and querying relationships. While translating natural language into SQL queries is well-researched, generating Cypher queries for Neo4j remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an automated, LLM-Supervised, pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data for Text2Cypher. Our Cypher data generation pipeline introduces LLM-As-Database-Filler, a novel strategy for ensuring Cypher query correctness, thus resulting in high quality generations. Using our pipeline, we generate high quality Text2Cypher data - SynthCypher containing 29.8k instances across various domains and queries with varying complexities. Training open-source LLMs like LLaMa-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B on SynthCypher results in performance gains of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test split and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark, adapted for graph databases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coreset selection, which involves selecting a small subset from an existing training dataset, is an approach to reducing training data, and various approaches have been proposed for this method. In practical situations where these methods are employed, it is often the case that the data distributions differ between the development phase and the deployment phase, with the latter being unknown. Thus, it is challenging to select an effective subset of training data that performs well across all deployment scenarios. We therefore propose Distributionally Robust Coreset Selection (DRCS). DRCS theoretically derives an estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, assuming that the future covariate distribution may deviate within a defined range from the training distribution. Furthermore, by selecting instances in a way that suppresses the estimate of the upper bound for the worst-case test error, DRCS achieves distributionally robust training instance selection. This study is primarily applicable to convex training computation, but we demonstrate that it can also be applied to deep learning under appropriate approximations. In this paper, we focus on covariate shift, a type of data distribution shift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DRCS through experiments.

  Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models for inference tasks in remote environments. However, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Through extensive evaluation on multiple camera trap deployments, we demonstrate that WildFit significantly improves accuracy while greatly reducing adaptation overhead compared to traditional approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leveraging sparsity is crucial for optimizing large language model inference. however, modern LLMs employing SiLU as their activation function exhibit minimal activation sparsity. Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Water infrastructures are essential for drinking water supply, irrigation, fire protection, and other critical applications. However, water pumping systems, which are key to transporting water to the point of use, consume significant amounts of energy and emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases annually. With the wide deployment of digital water meters and sensors in these infrastructures, Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to optimize water supply control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerability of ML methods in terms of worst-case performance raises safety concerns when deployed in critical water infrastructures. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-augmented online control algorithm, termed LAOC, designed to dynamically schedule the activation and/or speed of water pumps. To ensure safety, we introduce a novel design of safe action sets for online control problems. By leveraging these safe action sets, LAOC can provably guarantee safety constraints while utilizing ML predictions to reduce energy and environmental costs. Our analysis reveals the tradeoff between safety requirements and average energy/environmental cost performance. Additionally, we conduct an experimental study on a building water supply system to demonstrate the empirical performance of LAOC. The results indicate that LAOC can effectively reduce environmental and energy costs while guaranteeing safety constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph databases (GDBs) like Neo4j and TigerGraph excel at handling interconnected data but lack advanced inference capabilities. Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions. With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day. However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities. In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless. We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.). Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) offer a powerful framework for multi-agent coordination but often rely on labor-intensive, manual problem construction. To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The ability to accomplish tasks via natural language instructions is one of the most efficient forms of interaction between humans and technology. This efficiency has been translated into practical applications with generative AI tools now allowing users to get things done through natural language queries. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift in this direction. With ongoing advancements in the field of generative AI, integrating natural language commands into sophisticated technical fields in science and engineering is becoming increasingly feasible. This paper introduces GeoSim.AI - a suite of AI assistants for numerical simulations in geomechanics - thereby demonstrating the transformative potential of generative AI in geotechnical engineering. We investigate how AI assistants powered by LLMs can streamline the process of creating complex simulation inputs and interpreting results by translating natural language instructions or image inputs into precise technical commands and scripts. This approach aims to bridge the gap between human intent and the intricate requirements of numerical modeling tools, potentially revolutionizing how researchers and engineers interact with simulation software. We present demonstrations involving AI assistants for performing slope stability analyses in various software packages. The demonstrations highlight the potential of this technology to significantly enhance productivity and accessibility in computational geomechanics. GeoSim.AI is under active development, continuously expanding the suite of AI assistants for various numerical simulation problems in geotechnical engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural network training tends to exploit the simplest features as shortcuts to greedily minimize training loss. However, some of these features might be spuriously correlated with the target labels, leading to incorrect predictions by the model. Several methods have been proposed to address this issue. Focusing on suppressing the spurious correlations with model training, they not only incur additional training cost, but also have limited practical utility as the model misbehavior due to spurious relations is usually discovered after its deployment. It is also often overlooked that spuriousness is a subjective notion. Hence, the precise questions that must be investigated are; to what degree a feature is spurious, and how we can proportionally distract the model's attention from it for reliable prediction. To this end, we propose a method that enables post-hoc neutralization of spurious feature impact, controllable to an arbitrary degree. We conceptualize spurious features as fictitious sub-classes within the original classes, which can be eliminated by a class removal scheme. We then propose a unique precise class removal technique that employs a single-weight modification, which entails negligible performance compromise for the remaining classes. We perform extensive experiments, demonstrating that by editing just a single weight in a post-hoc manner, our method achieves highly competitive, or better performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid expansion of large language model (LLM) applications, there is an emerging shift in the role of LLM-based AI chatbots from serving merely as general inquiry tools to acting as professional service agents. However, current studies often overlook a critical aspect of professional service agents: the act of communicating in a manner consistent with their professional identities. This is of particular importance in the healthcare sector, where effective communication with patients is essential for achieving professional goals, such as promoting patient well-being by encouraging healthy behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional Identity), a novel framework for designing professional service agent tailored for medical question-and-answer (Q\&A) services, ensuring alignment with a specific professional identity. Our method includes a theory-guided task planning process that decomposes complex professional tasks into manageable subtasks aligned with professional objectives and a pragmatic entropy method designed to generate professional and ethical responses with low uncertainty. Experiments on various LLMs show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, across key metrics such as fluency, naturalness, empathy, patient-centricity, and ROUGE-L scores. Additionally, the ablation study underscores the contribution of each component to the overall effectiveness of the approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Observability in cloud infrastructure is critical for service providers, driving the widespread adoption of anomaly detection systems for monitoring metrics. However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We employ an audit design to investigate biases in state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-4. In our study, we prompt the models for advice involving a named individual across a variety of scenarios, such as during car purchase negotiations or election outcome predictions. We find that the advice systematically disadvantages names that are commonly associated with racial minorities and women. Names associated with Black women receive the least advantageous outcomes. The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting audits at the point of LLM deployment and implementation to mitigate their potential for harm against marginalized communities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq, enables the creation of high-quality software. However, the verification process requires significant expertise and manual effort to write proofs. Recent work has explored automating proof synthesis using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). This work has shown that identifying relevant premises, such as lemmas and definitions, can aid synthesis. We present Rango, a fully automated proof synthesis tool for Coq that automatically identifies relevant premises and also similar proofs from the current project and uses them during synthesis. Rango uses retrieval augmentation at every step of the proof to automatically determine which proofs and premises to include in the context of its fine-tuned LLM. In this way, Rango adapts to the project and to the evolving state of the proof. We create a new dataset, CoqStoq, of 2,226 open-source Coq projects and 196,929 theorems from GitHub, which includes both training data and a curated evaluation benchmark of well-maintained projects. On this benchmark, Rango synthesizes proofs for 32.0% of the theorems, which is 29% more theorems than the prior state-of-the-art tool Tactician. Our evaluation also shows that Rango adding relevant proofs to its context leads to a 47% increase in the number of theorems proven.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language generation but often confidently produce incorrect responses, especially in tasks like mathematical reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting, self-verification, and multi-agent debate are among the strategies proposed to improve the reasoning and factual accuracy of LLMs. Building on Du et al.'s multi-agent debate framework, we find that multi-agent debate helps at any model scale, and that diversity of thought elicits stronger reasoning in debating LLMs. Across various model sizes, performance on mathematical reasoning tasks benefits most when diverse trained models are used. Remarkably, after 4 rounds of debate, a diverse set of medium-capacity models (Gemini-Pro, Mixtral 7BX8, and PaLM 2-M) outperforms GPT-4 on the GSM-8K benchmark, scoring 91% accuracy. By comparison, when 3 instances of Gemini-Pro are used, performance only reaches 82%. Finally, this diverse set of medium-capacity models sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the ASDiv benchmark (94%). These results underscore the idea that the future of AI is agentic, with diverse cooperating agents yielding emergent capabilities beyond even the most powerful individual models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serverless computing adopts a pay-as-you-go billing model where applications are executed in stateless and shortlived containers triggered by events, resulting in a reduction of monetary costs and resource utilization. However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.

While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, privacy concerns limit their accessibility. This study develops a pipeline for automated note sectioning using open-source LLMs, focusing on three sections: History of Present Illness, Interval History, and Assessment and Plan. We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92). On the external validity test set, performance remained high (F1= 0.85). Fine-tuned open-source LLMs can surpass proprietary models in clinical note sectioning, offering advantages in cost, performance, and accessibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing approaches for low-resource text summarization primarily employ large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4 at inference time to generate summaries directly; however, such approaches often suffer from inconsistent LLM outputs and are difficult to adapt to domain-specific data in low-resource scenarios. In this work, we propose two novel methods to effectively utilize LLMs for low-resource text summarization: 1) MixSumm, an LLM-based data augmentation regime that synthesizes high-quality documents (short and long) for few-shot text summarization, and 2) PPSL, a prompt-based pseudolabeling strategy for sample-efficient semi-supervised text summarization. Specifically, MixSumm leverages the open-source LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate new documents by mixing topical information derived from a small seed set, and PPSL leverages the LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a semi-supervised learning setup. We evaluate our methods on the TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed datasets and use L-Eval, a LLaMA-3-based evaluation metric, and ROUGE scores to measure the quality of generated summaries. Our experiments on extractive and abstractive summarization show that MixSumm and PPSL achieve competitive ROUGE scores as a fully supervised method with 5% of the labeled data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Extracting real-time insights from multi-modal data streams from various domains such as healthcare, intelligent transportation, and satellite remote sensing remains a challenge. High computational demands and limited knowledge scope restrict the applicability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) on these data streams. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address knowledge limitations of these models, but suffer from slow preprocessing, making them unsuitable for real-time analysis. We propose StreamingRAG, a novel RAG framework designed for streaming data. StreamingRAG constructs evolving knowledge graphs capturing scene-object-entity relationships in real-time. The knowledge graph achieves temporal-aware scene representations using MM-LLMs and enables timely responses for specific events or user queries. StreamingRAG addresses limitations in existing methods, achieving significant improvements in real-time analysis (5-6x faster throughput), contextual accuracy (through a temporal knowledge graph), and reduced resource consumption (using lightweight models by 2-3x).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models improve with increasing amounts of high-quality training data. However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) have been deployed in various real-world settings, concerns about the harm they may propagate have grown. Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data in the training of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecule optimization is a critical task in drug discovery to optimize desired properties of a given molecule. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) holding the potential to efficiently simulate this task by using natural language to direct the optimization, straightforwardly utilizing them shows limited performance. In this work, we facilitate utilizing LLMs in an iterative paradigm by proposing a simple yet effective domain feedback provider, namely $\text{Re}^2$DF. In detail, $\text{Re}^2$DF harnesses an external toolkit, RDKit, to handle the molecule hallucination, if the modified molecule is chemically invalid. Otherwise, $\text{Re}^2$DF verifies whether the modified molecule meets the objective, if not, its desired properties are computed and compared to the original one, establishing reliable domain feedback with correct direction and distance towards the objective to explicitly guide the LLM to refine the modified molecule. We conduct experiments across both single- and multi-property objectives with 2 thresholds, where $\text{Re}^2$DF shows significant improvements. Notably, for 20 single-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 16.96% and 20.76% under loose (\texttt{l}) and strict (\texttt{s}) thresholds, respectively. For 32 multi-property objectives, $\text{Re}^2$DF enhances Hit ratio by 6.04% and 5.25%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Purpose: The purpose of this study is to harness the efficiency of a 2D foundation model to develop a robust phase classifier that is resilient to domain shifts.   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study utilized three public datasets from separate institutions. A 2D foundation model was trained on the DeepLesion dataset (mean age: 51.2, s.d.: 17.6; 2398 males) to generate embeddings from 2D CT slices for downstream contrast phase classification. The classifier was trained on the VinDr Multiphase dataset and externally validated on the WAW-TACE dataset. The 2D model was also compared to three 3D supervised models.   Results: On the VinDr dataset (146 male, 63 female, 56 unidentified), the model achieved near-perfect AUROC scores and F1 scores of 99.2%, 94.2%, and 93.1% for non-contrast, arterial, and venous phases, respectively. The `Other' category scored lower (F1: 73.4%) due to combining multiple contrast phases into one class. On the WAW-TACE dataset (mean age: 66.1, s.d.: 10.0; 185 males), the model showed strong performance with AUROCs of 91.0% and 85.6%, and F1 scores of 87.3% and 74.1% for non-contrast and arterial phases. Venous phase performance was lower, with AUROC and F1 scores of 81.7% and 70.2% respectively, due to label mismatches. Compared to 3D supervised models, the approach trained faster, performed as well or better, and showed greater robustness to domain shifts.   Conclusion: The robustness of the 2D Foundation model may be potentially useful for automation of hanging protocols and data orchestration for clinical deployment of AI algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of end-user applications powered by large language models (LLMs), including both conversational interfaces and add-ons to existing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), introduces new privacy challenges. However, many users remain unaware of the risks. This paper explores methods to increase user awareness of privacy risks associated with LLMs in end-user applications. We conducted five co-design workshops to uncover user privacy concerns and their demand for contextual privacy information within LLMs. Based on these insights, we developed CLEAR (Contextual LLM-Empowered Privacy Policy Analysis and Risk Generation), a just-in-time contextual assistant designed to help users identify sensitive information, summarize relevant privacy policies, and highlight potential risks when sharing information with LLMs. We evaluated the usability and usefulness of CLEAR across two example domains: ChatGPT and the Gemini plugin in Gmail. Our findings demonstrated that CLEAR is easy to use and improves users' understanding of data practices and privacy risks. We also discussed LLM's duality in posing and mitigating privacy risks, offering design and policy implications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of text-to-image synthesis has introduced powerful generative models capable of creating realistic images from textual prompts. However, precise control over image attributes remains challenging, especially at the instance level. While existing methods offer some control through fine-tuning or auxiliary information, they often face limitations in flexibility and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), open-vocabulary detectors, cross-attention maps and intermediate activations of diffusion U-Net for instance-level image manipulation. Our method detects objects mentioned in the prompt and present in the generated image, enabling precise manipulation without extensive training or input masks. By incorporating cross-attention maps, our approach ensures coherence in manipulated images while controlling object positions. Our method enables precise manipulations at the instance level without fine-tuning or auxiliary information such as masks or bounding boxes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging AI technologies have the potential to drive economic growth and innovation but can also pose significant risks to society. To mitigate these risks, governments, companies, and researchers have contributed regulatory frameworks, risk assessment approaches, and safety benchmarks, but these can lack nuance when considered in global deployment contexts. One way to understand these nuances is by looking at how the media reports on AI, as news media has a substantial influence on what negative impacts of AI are discussed in the public sphere and which impacts are deemed important. In this work, we analyze a broad and diverse sample of global news media spanning 27 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, Middle East, North America, and Oceania to gain valuable insights into the risks and harms of AI technologies as reported and prioritized across media outlets in different countries. This approach reveals a skewed prioritization of Societal Risks followed by Legal & Rights-related Risks, Content Safety Risks, Cognitive Risks, Existential Risks, and Environmental Risks, as reflected in the prevalence of these risk categories in the news coverage of different nations. Furthermore, it highlights how the distribution of such concerns varies based on the political bias of news outlets, underscoring the political nature of AI risk assessment processes and public opinion. By incorporating views from various regions and political orientations for assessing the risks and harms of AI, this work presents stakeholders, such as AI developers and policy makers, with insights into the AI risks categories prioritized in the public sphere. These insights my guide the development of more inclusive, safe, and responsible AI technologies that address the diverse concerns and needs across the world.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adolescence is a critical stage often linked to risky behaviors, including substance use, with significant developmental and public health implications. Social media provides a lens into adolescent self-expression, but interpreting emotional and contextual signals remains complex. This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze adolescents' social media posts, uncovering emotional patterns (e.g., sadness, guilt, fear, joy) and contextual factors (e.g., family, peers, school) related to substance use. Heatmap and machine learning analyses identified key predictors of substance use-related posts. Negative emotions like sadness and guilt were significantly more frequent in substance use contexts, with guilt acting as a protective factor, while shame and peer influence heightened substance use risk. Joy was more common in non-substance use discussions. Peer influence correlated strongly with sadness, fear, and disgust, while family and school environments aligned with non-substance use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional vulnerabilities and contextual influences, suggesting that collaborative interventions involving families, schools, and communities can reduce risk factors and foster healthier adolescent development.
