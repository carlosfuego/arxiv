                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in learning techniques that employ coordinate-based neural representations have yielded remarkable results in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. However, these approaches often require a substantial number of input views (typically several tens) and computationally intensive optimization procedures to achieve their effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations specifically for the problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. We accomplish this by incorporating a probabilistic shape and appearance prior into coordinate-based representations, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization when working with only a few input images (even as low as a single image). During testing, we leverage this prior to guide the fitting process of a signed distance function using a differentiable renderer. By incorporating the statistical prior alongside parallelizable ray tracing and dynamic caching strategies, we achieve an efficient and accurate approach to few-shot full 3D head reconstruction. Moreover, we extend the H3DS dataset, which now comprises 60 high-resolution 3D full head scans and their corresponding posed images and masks, which we use for evaluation purposes. By leveraging this dataset, we demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry reconstruction while being an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quick Merkle Database (QMDB) addresses longstanding bottlenecks in blockchain state management by integrating key-value (KV) and Merkle tree storage into a single unified architecture. QMDB delivers a significant throughput improvement over existing architectures, achieving up to 6X over the widely used RocksDB and 8X over NOMT, a leading verifiable database. Its novel append-only twig-based design enables one SSD read per state access, O(1) IOs for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a memory footprint as small as 2.3 bytes per entry, enabling it to run on even modest consumer-grade PCs. QMDB scales seamlessly across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2.28 million state updates per second. This performance enables support for 1 million token transfers per second (TPS), marking QMDB as the first solution achieving such a milestone. QMDB has been benchmarked with workloads exceeding 15 billion entries (10X Ethereum's 2024 state) and has proven the capacity to scale to 280 billion entries on a single server. Furthermore, QMDB introduces historical proofs, unlocking the ability to query its blockchain's historical state at the latest block. QMDB not only meets the demands of current blockchains but also provides a robust foundation for building scalable, efficient, and verifiable decentralized applications across diverse use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.64x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Compared to state-of-art speculative decoding methods, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding extra memory overhead while achieving up to 1.55x speedup in batched serving with a high acceptance rate. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great performance on visual question answering (VQA). When it comes to knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack the specialized domain knowledge needed to answer questions, necessitating the retrieval of necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented MLLMs with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved knowledge for a given image-question pair, generating a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 63.92\% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0\%-59.7\% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize the compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 2/3), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

However, existing work primarily focuses on the online setting, overlooking the substantial costs of online interactions and the readily available offline datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Off-CMAB, the first offline learning framework for CMAB. Central to our framework is the combinatorial lower confidence bound (CLCB) algorithm, which combines pessimistic reward estimations with combinatorial solvers. To characterize the quality of offline datasets, we propose two novel data coverage conditions and prove that, under these conditions, CLCB achieves a near-optimal suboptimality gap, matching the theoretical lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. We validate Off-CMAB through practical applications, including learning to rank, large language model (LLM) caching, and social influence maximization, showing its ability to handle nonlinear reward functions, general feedback models, and out-of-distribution action samples that excludes optimal or even feasible actions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets further highlight the superior performance of CLCB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching (especially over-caching). On the ImageNet dataset, without significantly increasing the computational burden, this method improves the quality of the generated images under the over-caching, rule-based, and training-based methods. Specifically, the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) values are improved as follows: from 6.857 to 5.821, from 3.870 to 3.692 and form 3.539 to 3.451 respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Decoder-only models generate tokens autoregressively by caching key/value vectors, but as the cache grows, inference becomes memory-bound. To address this issue, we introduce CLOVER (Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors), a novel approach that treats pairs of attention layers as a set of low-rank decompositions. CLOVER applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the \( Q \)-\( K \) and \( V \)-\( O \) pairs within each attention head. The resulting singular values can either guide pruning or serve as trainable parameters for efficient fine-tuning of all orthogonal vectors. After pruning or fine-tuning, these values are reintegrated into the model without increasing its parameter count. We apply CLOVER to various models, including GPT-2 XL, DeepSeek-V2-Lite, Whisper-Large-v3, Stable Diffusion XL, and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision. Our results demonstrate that CLOVER significantly improves pruning efficiency. For instance, the perplexity of pruning 70\% of the \( Q \)-\( K \) pairs in GPT-2 XL is similar to that of pruning just 8\% with vanilla methods. Fine-tuning the singular values further results in a full-rank update, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (LoRA, DoRA, HiRA, and PiSSA) by 7.6\%, 5.5\%, 3.8\%, and 0.7\%, respectively, on eight commonsense tasks for LLaMA-2 7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Elastic computing enables dynamic scaling to meet workload demands, and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enhances this by providing high-throughput, low-latency network communication. However, integrating RDMA into elastic computing remains a challenge, particularly in control plane operations for RDMA connection setup.   This paper revisits the assumptions of prior work on high-performance RDMA for elastic computing, and reveals that extreme microsecond-level control plane optimizations are often unnecessary. By challenging the conventional beliefs on the slowness of user-space RDMA control plane and the difficulty of user-space RDMA resource sharing, we uncover new design opportunities. Our key insight is that user-space RDMA connection setup can be significantly improved with caching, while RDMA resources can be efficiently shared among processes using fork. In light of this, we propose Swift, a simple yet effective solution that co-designs RDMA with a serverless framework to optimize performance for elastic computing. At its very core, Swift handles cold and warm serverless requests by swiftly initializing the RDMA control plane with cache-optimized libibverbs, and manages fork requests by leveraging the RDMA's fork capability. Implemented with OpenWhisk, Swift delivers 30.56-46.50% higher average throughput and 18.55-37.21% lower latency, at a cost of 6.5% control plane overhead, compared to prior solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique is widely used to characterize the electronic properties of semiconductor materials and devices. Its main advantage over other charge collection microscopies stems in the use of MeV ion probes, which provide both measurable induced charge signals from single ions, and high spatial resolution, which is maintained along the ion range. It is a fact, however, that the use of low-energy ions in the keV range can provide the IBIC technique with complementary analytical capabilities, that are not available with MeV ions, for example the higher sensitivity to the status, contamination and morphology of the surface and the fact that the induced signal depends on the transport of only one type of charge carrier. This paper outlines the upgrade that was made at the 100 kV ion implanter of the University of Torino, originally installed for material and surface modification, to explore the rather unexplored keV-IBIC field and to assess its potential to characterize semiconductor devices. Finally, we report the first IBIC application of our apparatus, which regards the assessment of the radiation damage of a commercially available silicon photodiode, adopting the IAEA experimental protocol and the relevant interpretative model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning provides an effective means to specialize pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning often incurs high memory overhead, especially for large transformer-based models, such as LLMs. While existing methods may reduce certain parts of the memory required for fine-tuning, they still require caching all intermediate activations computed in the forward pass to update weights during the backward pass. In this work, we develop TokenTune, a method to reduce memory usage, specifically the memory to store intermediate activations, in the fine-tuning of transformer-based models. During the backward pass, TokenTune approximates the gradient computation by backpropagating through just a subset of input tokens. Thus, with TokenTune, only a subset of intermediate activations are cached during the forward pass. Also, TokenTune can be easily combined with existing methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory cost. We evaluate our approach on pre-trained transformer models with up to billions of parameters, considering the performance on multiple downstream tasks such as text classification and question answering in a few-shot learning setup. Overall, TokenTune achieves performance on par with full fine-tuning or representative memory-efficient fine-tuning methods, while greatly reducing the memory footprint, especially when combined with other methods with complementary memory reduction mechanisms. We hope that our approach will facilitate the fine-tuning of large transformers, in specializing them for specific domains or co-training them with other neural components from a larger system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilizations as datacenter topologies (and network failures as a consequence) continue to grow. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and introduces less than 25 bytes of per-connection state. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the State Stream Transformer (SST), a novel LLM architecture that reveals emergent reasoning behaviours and capabilities latent in pretrained weights through addressing a fundamental limitation in traditional transformer models: the lack of latent computational continuity across autoregressive generations in the state space. SST introduces a sliding window latent state (FFN) cache with weighted decay that maintains and evolves persistent latent processes throughout autoregressive generations. Through controlled experiments comparing base and SST architectures using the same frozen weights, we demonstrate that this architectural modification alone enables enhanced reasoning capabilities which appear best explained by some form of potential higher-order processing, as evidenced by emergent metacognitive behaviours. These behaviours persist under controlled conditions designed to eliminate confounding factors such as stochastic variation or learned response patterns. Analysis of latent state distributions and processing dynamics provides evidence that it is solely the 'state stream' that is responsible for these phenomena. In quantitative evaluations, the SST achieves substantial performance improvements over the base model on two reasoning benchmarks, reaching 89.01\% accuracy on GSM-8K (0-shot) and 91.04\% on ARC Challenge (0-shot CoT). These findings indicate that persistent computation in the latent state space enables fundamentally different information processing and internal reasoning strategies, with implications for our understanding of artificial intelligence systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling the input context length of a large language model (LLM) incurs a significant increase in computation cost and memory footprint to maintain the attention key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods suffer from inefficient compression strategies and limited memory reduction effects, making it difficult for LLMs to conduct long-context inference on consumer-grade devices, especially when inferring long-context stream input. Such obstacles prevent consumer-grade devices from supporting more complex applications, creating challenges for the democratization of LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Locret, the first framework to create an eviction policy compatible with chunked prefill. By evaluating the causal importance of KV cache units by learnable retaining heads, Locret enables precise eviction of cache units, facilitating efficient long-context inference. In our extensive empirical studies, Locret outperforms the recent popular and competitive approaches in terms of memory efficiency and generation quality -- Locret achieves up to 20x of KV cache compression ratio within less than 10% performance loss. Furthermore, Locret achieves 128K+ long-context inference on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU without compromising generation quality and only costs <1 GPU hour of additional training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Randomizing the address-to-set mapping and partitioning of the cache has been shown to be an effective mechanism in designing secured caches. Several designs have been proposed on a variety of rationales: (1) randomized design, (2) randomized-and-partitioned design, and (3) psuedo-fully associative design. This work fills in a crucial gap in current literature on randomized caches: currently most randomized cache designs defend only contention-based attacks, and leave out considerations of cache occupancy. We perform a systematic evaluation of 5 randomized cache designs- CEASER, CEASER-S, MIRAGE, Scatter-Cache, and Sass-cache against cache occupancy wrt. both performance as well as security.   With respect to performance, we first establish that benchmarking strategies used by contemporary designs are unsuitable for a fair evaluation (because of differing cache configurations, choice of benchmarking suites, additional implementation-specific assumptions). We thus propose a uniform benchmarking strategy, which allows us to perform a fair and comparative analysis across all designs under various replacement policies. Likewise, with respect to security against cache occupancy attacks, we evaluate the cache designs against various threat assumptions: (1) covert channels, (2) process fingerprinting, and (3) AES key recovery (to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate full AES key recovery on a randomized cache design using cache occupancy attack). Our results establish the need to also consider cache occupancy side-channel in randomized cache design considerations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present "Reciprocating Locks", a novel mutual exclusion locking algorithm, targeting cache-coherent shared memory (CC), that enjoys a number of desirable properties. The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in constant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting element is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread might hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO admission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock is compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily usable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux kernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under contention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of Reciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best state-of-the-art scalable spin locks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> PagedAttention is a popular approach for dynamic memory allocation in LLM serving systems. It enables on-demand allocation of GPU memory to mitigate KV cache fragmentation -- a phenomenon that crippled the batch size (and consequently throughput) in prior systems. However, in trying to allocate physical memory at runtime, PagedAttention ends up changing the virtual memory layout of the KV cache from contiguous to non-contiguous. Such a design leads to non-trivial programming and performance overheads.   We present vAttention -- an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical memory while retaining the contiguity of KV cache in virtual memory. We achieve this by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA virtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific optimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support. Overall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to PagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and improves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23x compared to the use of PagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing demand for efficient cloud storage solutions has led to the widespread adoption of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for caching in cloud block storage systems. The management of data writes to SSD caches plays a crucial role in improving overall system performance, reducing latency, and extending the lifespan of storage devices. A critical challenge arises from the large volume of write-only data, which significantly impacts the performance of SSD caches when handled inefficiently. Specifically, writes that have not been read for a certain period may introduce unnecessary write traffic to the SSD cache without offering substantial benefits for cache performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to mitigate this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to dynamically optimize the write policy in cloud-based storage systems. The proposed method identifies write-only data and selectively filters it out in real-time, thereby minimizing the number of unnecessary write operations and improving the overall performance of the cache system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning-based policy significantly outperforms traditional approaches by reducing the number of harmful writes and optimizing cache utilization. This solution is particularly suitable for cloud environments with varying and unpredictable workloads, where traditional cache management strategies often fall short.

This study explores the application of streaming machine learning [3] to revolutionize data prefetching within multi-tiered storage systems. Unlike traditional batch-trained models, streaming machine learning [5] offers adaptability, real-time insights, and computational efficiency, responding dynamically to workload variations. This work designs and validates an innovative framework that integrates streaming classification models for predicting file access patterns, specifically the next file offset. Leveraging comprehensive feature engineering and real-time evaluation over extensive production traces, the proposed methodology achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, memory efficiency, and system adaptability. The results underscore the potential of streaming models in real-time storage management, setting a precedent for advanced caching and tiering strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.

While colocating applications can improve utilization, current spatial sharing systems lack performance guarantees. Providing predictable performance guarantees requires a deep understanding of how applications contend for shared GPU resources such as block schedulers, compute units, L1/L2 caches, and memory bandwidth. We propose a methodology to profile resource interference of GPU kernels across these dimensions and discuss how to build GPU schedulers that provide strict performance guarantees while colocating applications to minimize cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints.} The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. \an{Our} numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the \an{SH cache hit rate}, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the classical caching problem, when a requested page is not present in the cache (i.e., a "miss"), it is assumed to travel from the backing store into the cache "before" the next request arrives. However, in many real-life applications, such as content delivery networks, this assumption is unrealistic.   The "delayed-hits" model for caching, introduced by Atre, Sherry, Wang, and Berger, accounts for the latency between a missed cache request and the corresponding arrival from the backing store. This theoretical model has two parameters: the "delay" $Z$, representing the ratio between the retrieval delay and the inter-request delay in an application, and the "cache size" $k$, as in classical caching. Classical caching corresponds to $Z=1$, whereas larger values of $Z$ model applications where retrieving missed requests is expensive. Despite the practical relevance of the delayed-hits model, its theoretical underpinnings are still poorly understood.   We present the first tight theoretical guarantee for optimizing delayed-hits caching: The "Least Recently Used" algorithm, a natural, deterministic, online algorithm widely used in practice, is $O(Zk)$-competitive, meaning it incurs at most $O(Zk)$ times more latency than the (offline) optimal schedule. Our result extends to any so-called "marking" algorithm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous architectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by SWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto single hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising solution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between critical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and system bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs), negatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade, academia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such as cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring these techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires balancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs tuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical and often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these techniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or conflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case execution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often fail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically focus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and interrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an open-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation configurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth reservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By providing insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations for mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-antenna coded caching (CC) with multicast beamforming typically relies on a complex successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure to decode a superposition of multiple streams received by each user. Signal-level CC schemes require the regeneration and cancellation of interfering signals at the physical layer of each receiver, which complicates practical implementations. To address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling linear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data terms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies and a novel sparse strategy are considered for constructing the coefficient matrix. The reference cases include the random strategy, which lacks control over matrix construction, and the equal-distant strategy, which balances users' interference and data terms equally. In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes the number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval. This approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design by decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of SINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a successive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and optimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering in place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from relevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in symmetric rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing weight-activation quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily address channel-wise outliers but often neglect token-wise outliers, which limits the accuracy of quantized models. In this work, we propose PrefixQuant, a novel quantization method that achieves state-of-the-art performance across various precision levels (W4A4KV4 and W4A8KV4) and granularities (dynamic and static quantization) by effectively isolating token-wise outliers. First, PrefixQuant eliminates token-wise outliers by prefixing outlier tokens in the KV cache, a process that is training-free and highly efficient (e.g., 1 minutes for Llama-3-70B). Second, PrefixQuant introduces new trainable parameters for block-wise training to compensate for quantization error. Our experiments show that PrefixQuant significantly outperforms existing dynamic quantization methods, even under coarser static quantization settings. For instance, PrefixQuant achieves an average accuracy improvement of +3.08 and +2.85 points over SpinQuant (dynamic quantization) on five zero-shot reasoning tasks under dynamic and static quantization settings, respectively, on W4A4KV4 Llama-3-8B. Additionally, we demonstrate up to 2.74x prefilling speedup and 2.16x decoding speedup for LLMs using W4A4 PrefixQuant. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce and study a multi-class online resource allocation problem with group fairness guarantees. The problem involves allocating a fixed amount of resources to a sequence of agents, each belonging to a specific group. The primary objective is to ensure fairness across different groups in an online setting. We focus on three fairness notions: one based on quantity and two based on utility. To achieve fair allocations, we develop two threshold-based online algorithms, proving their optimality under two fairness notions and near-optimality for the more challenging one. Additionally, we demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between group fairness and individual welfare using a novel representative function-based approach. To address this trade-off, we propose a set-aside multi-threshold algorithm that reserves a portion of the resource to ensure fairness across groups while utilizing the remaining resource to optimize efficiency under utility-based fairness notions. This algorithm is proven to achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off. We also demonstrate that our problem can model a wide range of real-world applications, including network caching and cloud computing, and empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms in the network caching problem using real datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As is known, hybrid quadratic and subquadratic attention models in multi-head architectures have surpassed both Transformer and Linear RNN models , with these works primarily focusing on reducing KV complexity and improving efficiency. For further research on expressiveness, we introduce our series of models distilled from Qwen 2.5, based on pure native RWKV-7 attention, which aims to make RNN more expressive and demonstrates state tracking ability beyond transformers. We work with QRWK 32B based on RWKV-6 architecture, another approach that reduces the entire knowledge processing time to just 8 hours using 16 AMD MI300X GPUs while maintaining Qwen 2.5's performance. In fact, the distillation process can utilize any LLM, not just Qwen, and enables knowledge transfer from larger LLMs to smaller ones with more fewer tokens. We will explain the detailed process and share our insights on building more powerful foundation models. Please note that this is an ongoing work that will be updated continuously.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tag-based browsing is a popular interaction model for navigating digital libraries. According to this model, users select descriptive tags to filter resources in the collections. Typical implementations of the model are based on inverted indexes. However, these implementations can require a considerable amount of set operations to update the browsing state. To palliate this inconven-ience, it is possible to adopt suitable cache strategies. In this paper we describe and compare two of these strategies: (i) a query-based strategy, according to which previously computed browsing states are indexed by sets of selected tags; and (ii) a resource-based strategy, according to which browsing states are in-dexed by sets of filtered resources. Our comparison focused on runtime perfor-mance, and was carried out empirically, using a real-world web-based collec-tion in the field of digital humanities. The results obtained show that the re-source-based strategy clearly outperforms the query-based one.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their applicability in diverse domains such as traffic network prediction, epidemiological forecasting, and social network analysis. In this paper, we present ReInc, a system designed to enable efficient and scalable training of DGNNs on large-scale graphs. ReInc introduces key innovations that capitalize on the unique combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) inherent in DGNNs. By reusing intermediate results and incrementally computing aggregations across consecutive graph snapshots, ReInc significantly enhances computational efficiency. To support these optimizations, ReInc incorporates a novel two-level caching mechanism with a specialized caching policy aligned to the DGNN execution workflow. Additionally, ReInc addresses the challenges of managing structural and temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs through a new distributed training strategy. This approach eliminates communication overheads associated with accessing remote features and redistributing intermediate results. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInc achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, tested across various dynamic GNN architectures and real-world graph datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, we propose a unified view on these selection problems. We make a detailed analysis of the root causes of their complexity and summarize techniques to address them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field. Based on our analysis we derive a method to exponentially accelerate some of the state-of-the-art selection algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory hierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely by the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the compiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into thread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a challenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the unpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at runtime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address this, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity pattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread to store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique that fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion kernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce the number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure of Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our second technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and global memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for greater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup compared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these speedups are 24.9x and 4.9x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache is a widely used acceleration technique for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, its memory requirement grows rapidly with input length. Previous studies have reduced the size of KV cache by either removing the same number of unimportant tokens for all attention heads or by allocating differentiated KV cache budgets for pre-identified attention heads. However, due to the importance of attention heads varies across different tasks, the pre-identified attention heads fail to adapt effectively to various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Task-KV, a method that leverages the semantic differentiation of attention heads to allocate differentiated KV cache budgets across various tasks. We demonstrate that attention heads far from the semantic center (called heterogeneous heads) make an significant contribution to task outputs and semantic understanding. In contrast, other attention heads play the role of aggregating important information and focusing reasoning. Task-KV allocates full KV cache budget to heterogeneous heads to preserve comprehensive semantic information, while reserving a small number of recent tokens and attention sinks for non-heterogeneous heads. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce middle activations to preserve key contextual information aggregated from non-heterogeneous heads. To dynamically perceive semantic differences among attention heads, we design a semantic separator to distinguish heterogeneous heads from non-heterogeneous ones based on their distances from the semantic center. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks and different model architectures demonstrate that Task-KV significantly outperforms existing baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) show remarkable performance in multimodal tasks. However, excessively long multimodal inputs lead to oversized Key-Value (KV) caches, resulting in significant memory consumption and I/O bottlenecks. Previous KV quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) may alleviate these issues but overlook the attention saliency differences of multimodal tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we investigate the attention-aware token saliency patterns in VLM and propose AKVQ-VL. AKVQ-VL leverages the proposed Text-Salient Attention (TSA) and Pivot-Token-Salient Attention (PSA) patterns to adaptively allocate bit budgets. Moreover, achieving extremely low-bit quantization requires effectively addressing outliers in KV tensors. AKVQ-VL utilizes the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) to construct outlier-free KV caches, thereby reducing quantization difficulty. Evaluations of 2-bit quantization on 12 long-context and multimodal tasks demonstrate that AKVQ-VL maintains or even improves accuracy, outperforming LLM-oriented methods. AKVQ-VL can reduce peak memory usage by 2.13x, support up to 3.25x larger batch sizes and 2.46x throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.

It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores. Alongside unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We perform initial measurements that provide practical insight into CXL0. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. These transformations enhance linearizable algorithms with durability under a general partial-failure model. We provide an additional transformation for algorithms designed for persistent main memory and full-system crashes. We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and modeling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To support the growing demand for data-intensive and low-latency IoT applications, Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as an effective edge-computing approach enabling the execution of delay-sensitive processing tasks close to end-users. However, most of the existing works on resource allocation and service placement in MEC systems overlook the unique characteristics of new IoT use cases. For instance, many IoT applications require the periodic execution of computing tasks on real-time data streams that originate from devices dispersed over a wide area. Thus, users requesting IoT services are typically distant from the data producers. To fill this gap, the contribution of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a MEC-compliant architectural solution to support the operation of multiple IoT service providers over a common MEC platform deployment, which enables the steering and shaping of IoT data transport within the platform. Secondly, we model the problem of service placement and data management in the proposed MEC-based solution taking into account the dependencies at the data level between IoT services and sensing resources. Our model also considers that caches can be deployed on MEC hosts, to allow the sharing of the same data between different IoT services with overlapping geographical scope, and provides support for IoT services with heterogeneous QoS requirements, such as different frequencies of periodic task execution. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed using linear relaxation and rounding techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, especially when traffic demands generated by the service requests are not uniform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks enable large-scale data collection by leveraging the ubiquity of mobile devices. However, frequent sensing and data transmission can lead to significant resource consumption. To mitigate this issue, edge caching has been proposed as a solution for storing recently collected data. Nonetheless, this approach may compromise data freshness. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in cache-enabled MCS networks, aiming to minimize system latency while maintaining information freshness. To this end, we formulate a weighted delay and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, jointly optimizing sensing decisions, user selection, channel selection, task allocation, and caching strategies. The problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programming problem which is intractable. Therefore, we decompose the long-term problem into sequential one-shot sub-problems and design a framework that optimizes system latency, task sensing decision, and caching strategy subproblems. When one task is re-sensing, the one-shot problem simplifies to the system latency minimization problem, which can be solved optimally. The task sensing decision is then made by comparing the system latency and AoI. Additionally, a Bayesian update strategy is developed to manage the cached task results. Building upon this framework, we propose a lightweight and time-efficient algorithm that makes real-time decisions for the long-term optimization problem. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) inference workload dominates a wide variety of modern AI applications, ranging from multi-turn conversation to document analysis. Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients.   This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, at 670 kV on the compact accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Seville, Spain, is now a reality. In this work, we present first Pu AMS results for environmental samples: a sediment core collected in a submarine canyon in the Mediterranean coast of the Spanish region of Palomares, affected by a nuclear accident in 1966. From the study of the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio profile, showing on average levels lower than 11%, we confirm that the weapon-grade plutonium released on land during the accident, with a characteristic 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of 5.8%, has found its way into the marine environment. A two-plutonium sources mixture model (Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium coming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring technique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples were also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS). The obtained AS 239+240Pu activity concentration results fit in with the AMS ones in a wide dynamic range, thus validating the AMS technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel yet simple and comprehensive DNS cache POisoning Prevention System (POPS), designed to integrate as a module in Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). POPS addresses statistical DNS poisoning attacks, including those documented from 2002 to the present, and offers robust protection against similar future threats. It consists of two main components: a detection module that employs three simple rules, and a mitigation module that leverages the TC flag in the DNS header to enhance security. Once activated, the mitigation module has zero false positives or negatives, correcting any such errors on the side of the detection module.   We first analyze POPS against historical DNS services and attacks, showing that it would have mitigated all network-based statistical poisoning attacks, yielding a success rate of only 0.0076% for the adversary. We then simulate POPS on traffic benchmarks (PCAPs) incorporating current potential network-based statistical poisoning attacks, and benign PCAPs; the simulated attacks still succeed with a probability of 0.0076%. This occurs because five malicious packets go through before POPS detects the attack and activates the mitigation module. In addition, POPS completes its task using only 20%-50% of the time required by other tools (e.g., Suricata or Snort), and after examining just 5%-10% as many packets. Furthermore, it successfully identifies DNS cache poisoning attacks-such as fragmentation attacks-that both Suricata and Snort fail to detect, underscoring its superiority in providing comprehensive DNS protection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

However, LLMs are sensitive to the position of relevant information within contexts and tend to generate incorrect responses when such information is placed in the middle, known as `Lost in the Middle' phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generates consistent outputs for decoder-only models, irrespective of the input context order. Experimental results for three open domain question answering tasks demonstrate position invariance, where the model is not sensitive to input context order, and superior robustness to irrelevent passages compared to prevailing approaches for RAG pipelines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in language processing tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by high memory demands and computational complexity. Although low-bit quantization techniques, such as 4-bit quantization, present a potential solution, they frequently lead to significant accuracy degradation or require substantial effort for such aggressive quantization approaches. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QRazor, a reliable and effortless quantization scheme designed to enable 4-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. The scheme involves two main stages: quantization and compression. During the quantization stage, weights, activations, and KV cache values are quantized with wider 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis to achieve nearly identical accuracy to the original full-precision LLM models, using the absolute max scaling. Subsequently, all data are compressed to 4-bit using our proposed significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four most salient bits while discarding the others. Furthermore, we present an integer-based arithmetic unit dedicated to QRazor, enabling direct low-precision arithmetic operations without decompressing the SDR data. Despite the reduced quantization effort, QRazor achieves LLM accuracies better or comparable to state-of-the-art 4-bit methods. By also validating the hardware efficiency, our decompression-free arithmetic unit achieves 61.2% and 57.8% reduction in area and power consumption, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Delivering an immersive experience to virtual reality (VR) users through wireless connectivity offers the freedom to engage from anywhere at any time. Nevertheless, it is challenging to ensure seamless wireless connectivity that delivers real-time and high-quality videos to the VR users. This paper proposes a field of view (FoV) aware caching for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network. In particular, the FoV of each VR user is cached/prefetched at the base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. Specifically, decentralized and personalized federated learning (DP-FL) based caching strategies with guarantees are presented. Considering VR systems composed of multiple VR devices and BSs, a DP-FL caching algorithm is implemented at each BS to personalize content delivery for VR users. The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost of communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient descent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Additionally, to better account for the wireless channel dynamics, the FoVs are grouped into multicast or unicast groups based on the number of requesting VR users. The performance of the proposed DP-FL algorithm is validated through realistic VR head-tracking dataset, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have better performance in terms of average delay and cache hit as compared to baseline algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although applications involving long-context inputs are crucial for the effective utilization of large language models (LLMs), they also result in increased computational costs and reduced performance. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient, training-free prompt compression method that retains key information within compressed prompts. We identify specific attention heads in transformer-based LLMs, which we designate as evaluator heads, that are capable of selecting tokens in long inputs that are most significant for inference. Building on this discovery, we develop EHPC, an Evaluator Head-based Prompt Compression method, which enables LLMs to rapidly "skim through" input prompts by leveraging only the first few layers with evaluator heads during the pre-filling stage, subsequently passing only the important tokens to the model for inference. EHPC achieves state-of-the-art results across two mainstream benchmarks: prompt compression and long-context inference acceleration. Consequently, it effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with commercial API calls. We further demonstrate that EHPC attains competitive results compared to key-value cache-based acceleration methods, thereby highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency of LLMs for long-context tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we study the coded caching scheme for the $(L, K, M, N)$ multi-user information retrieval (MIR) system, which consists of a content library containing $N$ files, a base station (BS) with $L$ antennas that cannot access the library, and $K$ single-antenna users, each of which can cache at most $M$ files from the library. The users communicate with the others assisted by the BS to decode their required files. In this paper, we focus on designing a coded caching scheme with low communication latency measured by normalized delivery time (NDT), computational complexity, and subpacketizations. When $\frac{KM}{N}\geq L$ we first simply the precoding matrix in the downlink step to an identity matrix and use the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output networks, to generate several new schemes for MIR system. Compared to the existing schemes, both the theoretical and numerical analyses show that our new schemes achieve much lower computational complexity and smaller subpacketizations with the same NDT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern GPUs, with their specialized hardware like tensor cores, are essential for demanding AI and deep learning applications. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-level microbenchmarking analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, delving into its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem latency and throughput, comparing its L2 partitioned cache behavior and global memory access patterns against recent GPU generations, Ampere and Ada Lovelace. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences and architectural improvements in Hopper. A core contribution of this work is a detailed evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores, including their FP8 precision support and the novel asynchronous wgmma instructions, assessing their impact on matrix multiply-accumulate operations. We further investigate the performance implications of other key Hopper innovations: DPX instructions for accelerating dynamic programming algorithms, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. This multi-level approach encompasses instruction-level microbenchmarks, library-level analysis of the Transformer Engine, and application-level benchmarks of tensor core performance within large language models. Our findings provide valuable, in-depth insights for software developers seeking to optimize performance and develop accurate performance models for the Hopper architecture, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of its potential for accelerating AI and other computationally intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Continuous Integration (CI) consists of an automated build process involving continuous compilation, testing, and packaging of the software system. While CI comes up with several advantages related to quality and time to delivery, CI also presents several challenges addressed by a large body of research. To better understand the literature so as to help practitioners find solutions for their problems and guide future research, we conduct a systematic review of 97 studies on build optimization published between 2006 and 2024, which we summarized according to their goals, methodologies, used datasets, and leveraged metrics. The identified build optimization studies focus on two main challenges: (1) long build durations, and (2) build failures. To meet the first challenge, existing studies have developed a range of techniques, including predicting build outcome and duration, selective build execution, and build acceleration using caching or repairing performance smells. The causes of build failures have been the subject of several studies, leading to the development of techniques for predicting build script maintenance and automating repair. Recent studies have also focused on predicting flaky build failures caused by environmental issues. The majority of these techniques use machine learning algorithms and leverage build metrics, which we classify into five categories. Additionally, we identify eight publicly available build datasets for build optimization research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Caching is an efficient technique to reduce peak traffic by storing popular content in local caches. Placement delivery array (PDA) proposed by Yan et al. is a combinatorial structure to design coded caching schemes with uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery. By taking the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a small base PDA, Wang et al. constructed a big PDA while maintaining the memory ratio and transmission load unchanged, which achieves linear growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain. In order to achieve exponential growth in both the number of users and coded caching gain, in this paper we propose a PDA construction by taking the union operation of the cache configurations from the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a base PDA. The resulting PDA leads to a coded caching scheme with subpacketization increasing sub-exponentially with the number of users while keeping the load constant for fixed memory ratio. By applying the proposed construction to existing base PDAs, three new coded caching schemes are obtained, which cover some existing schemes as special cases and can achieve lower load with simultaneously lower subpacketization for some memory ratios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their inference demands substantial resources, while under-utilizing high-end accelerators like GPUs. A major bottleneck arises from the attention mechanism, which requires storing large key-value caches, limiting the maximum achievable throughput way below the available computing resources. Current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through memory-efficient attention and paging mechanisms, but remained constrained by the assumption that all operations must be performed on high-end accelerators.   In this work, we propose Glinthawk, a two-tiered architecture that decouples the attention mechanism from the rest of the Transformer model. This approach allows the memory requirements for attention to scale independently, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient use of the high-end accelerators. We prototype Glinthawk with NVIDIA T4 GPUs as one tier and standard CPU VMs as the other. Compared to a traditional single-tier setup, it improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$. For longer sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-oriented applications such as batch processing. We shared our prototype publicly at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a two-layer hierarchical coded caching network where a server with a library of $N$ files is connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each having a cache memory of size $M_1$. Each mirror is further connected to $K_2$ users, each equipped with a dedicated cache of size $M_2$. In this paper, we propose two distinct coded caching schemes based on coded placement, corresponding to two distinct memory pairs, \( (M_1, M_2) \). We show that the proposed schemes outperform the existing schemes at these memory points given by the proposed schemes for smaller values of $K_2$. In setups where mirrors are positioned near each other, avoiding signal interference is crucial. This can be ensured by having all mirrors transmit using orthogonal carrier frequencies. To compare our schemes with existing ones, we used the composite rate metric, which accurately represents the total bandwidth utilized in such setups. The composite rate is given by $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to the mirrors, and $R_2$ is the rate from the mirrors to the users, with respect to $M_1$ and $M_2$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing popularity of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has led to its widespread application in various visual downstream tasks. To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol by introducing lazy latch-release and invalidation messages, thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We examine a two-layered hierarchical coded caching problem, a configuration addressed in existing research. This involves a server connected to $K_1$ mirrors, each of which serves $K_2$ users. The mirrors and the users are equipped with caches of size $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. We propose a hierarchical coded caching scheme with coded placements that outperforms existing schemes. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce the notion of composite rate, defined as $\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the rate from the server to mirrors and $R_2$ is the rate from mirrors to users. The composite rate has not been discussed before in the literature and is pertinent when mirrors transmit with different carrier frequencies. For the proposed scheme, we show a trade-off between the global memory $\overline{M}=K_1M_1+K_1K_2M_2$ of the system and the composite rate and compare with the existing schemes. Additionally, we conduct this comparative analysis by plotting $R_1$ + $R_2$ against global memory, which is particularly beneficial for systems wherein each mirror can utilize the same carrier frequency, given their significant spatial separation. Additionally, we propose an optimized scheme for the specific case of a single mirror, showing improved performance in this scenario.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper considers wireless device-to-device (D2D) coded caching in a multiaccess network, where the users communicate with each other and each user can access multiple cache nodes. Access topologies derived from two combinatorial designs known as the $t$-design and $t$-group divisible design ($t$-GDD), referred to as the $t$-design and $t$-GDD topologies respectively, which subsume a few other known topologies, have been studied for the multiaccess coded caching (MACC) network by Cheng \textit{et al.} in \cite{MACC_des}. These access topologies are extended to a multiaccess D2D coded caching (MADCC) network and novel MADCC schemes are proposed. MADCC network has been studied so far only for the cyclic wrap-around topology. Apart from the proposed novel MADCC schemes, MADCC schemes are also derived from the existing MACC schemes in \cite{MACC_des}. To compare the performance of different MADCC schemes, the metrics of load per user and subpacketization level are used while keeping the number of caches and cache memory size same. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level while achieving the same load per user compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-design topology in \cite{MACC_des}. The proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of load per user while achieving the same subpacketization level compared to the MADCC scheme derived from the MACC scheme with $t$-GDD topology in \cite{MACC_des} in some cases. Compared to the existing MADCC scheme with cyclic wrap-around topology, the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-design topology performs better in terms of load per user, and the proposed MADCC scheme with $t$-GDD topology performs better in terms of subpacketization level at the expense of an increase in load per user.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The CXL-based solid-state drive (CXL-SSD) provides a promising approach towards scaling the main memory capacity at low cost. However, the CXL-SSD faces performance challenges due to the long flash access latency and unpredictable events such as garbage collection in the SSD device, stalling the host processor and wasting compute cycles. Although the CXL interface enables the byte-granular data access to the SSD, accessing flash chips is still at page granularity due to physical limitations. The mismatch of access granularity causes significant unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips, worsening the suboptimal end-to-end data access performance. In this paper, we present SkyByte, an efficient CXL-based SSD that employs a holistic approach to address the aforementioned challenges by co-designing the host operating system (OS) and SSD controller. To alleviate the long memory stall when accessing the CXL-SSD, SkyByte revisits the OS context switch mechanism and enables opportunistic context switches upon the detection of long access delays. To accommodate byte-granular data accesses, SkyByte architects the internal DRAM of the SSD controller into a cacheline-level write log and a page-level data cache, and enables data coalescing upon log cleaning to reduce the I/O traffic to flash chips. SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include adaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host memory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with a CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive applications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based SSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average. SkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes unlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective solution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Let k be a field, let G be an affine algebraic k-group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. We say V is rigid if the socle series and radical series coincide for the action of G on each indecomposable summand of V; say V is geometrically rigid (resp. absolutely rigid) if V is rigid after base change of G and V to k (resp. any field extension of k). We show that all simple G-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More precisely, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite purely inseparable extension kV /k naturally attached to V such that V is absolutely rigid as a G-module after base change to kV. The proof turns on an investigation of algebras of the form K otimes E where K and E are field extensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a module over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field extension kV /k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.   In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and representation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to give a concrete description of kV when G is smooth and connected. Namely, we combine the main structure theorem of the Conrad-Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with our previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the minimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of EndG(V) in terms of the high weight of V and the Conrad-Prasad classification data; this gives a concrete construction of the field kV as a subextension of the minimal field of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G. We also observe that the Conrad-Prasad classification can be used to hone the dimension formula for V we had previously established; we also use it to give a description of EndG(V) which includes a dimension formula.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a modern cloud server which occupies a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to the efficient operation of the machine, but unlike application-oriented compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency. Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path. However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernel-bypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) increasingly play an important role in a wide range of information processing and management tasks. Many of these tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that are about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache management. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the request-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill chunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the GPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared Attention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch overhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang by 1.3$\times$ to 10.8$\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical industry workload under different hardware environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-cache computing technology transforms existing caches into long-vector compute units and offers low-cost alternatives to building expensive vector engines for mobile CPUs. Unfortunately, existing long-vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, such as RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) and Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), provide only one-dimensional strided and random memory accesses. While this is sufficient for typical vector engines, it fails to effectively utilize the large Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) widths of in-cache vector engines. This is because mobile data-parallel kernels expose limited parallelism across a single dimension.   Based on our analysis of mobile vector kernels, we introduce a long-vector Multi-dimensional Vector ISA Extension (MVE) for mobile in-cache computing. MVE achieves high SIMD resource utilization and enables flexible programming by abstracting cache geometry and data layout. The proposed ISA features multi-dimensional strided and random memory accesses and efficient dimension-level masked execution to encode parallelism across multiple dimensions. Using a wide range of data-parallel mobile workloads, we demonstrate that MVE offers significant performance and energy reduction benefits of 2.9x and 8.8x, on average, compared to the SIMD units of a commercial mobile processor, at an area overhead of 3.6%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Memory-disk synchronization is a critical technology for ensuring data correctness, integrity, and security, especially in systems that handle sensitive information like financial transactions and medical records. We propose SYNC+SYNC, a group of attacks that exploit the memory-disk synchronization primitives. SYNC+SYNC works by subtly varying the timing of synchronization on the write buffer, offering several advantages: 1) implemented purely in software, enabling deployment on any hardware devices; 2) resilient against existing cache partitioning and randomization techniques; 3) unaffected by prefetching techniques and cache replacement strategies. We present the principles of SYNC+SYNC through the implementation of two write covert channel protocols, using either a single file or page, and introduce three enhanced strategies that utilize multiple files and pages. The feasibility of these channels is demonstrated in both cross-process and cross-sandbox scenarios across diverse operating systems (OSes). Experimental results show that, the average rate can reach 2.036 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 14.762 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0% on Linux; when running on macOS, the average rate achieves 10.211 Kb/s (with a peak rate of 253.022 Kb/s) and the error rate is 0.004%. To the best of our knowledge, SYNC+SYNC is the first high-speed write covert channel for software cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mobile edge Large Language Model (LLM) deployments face inherent constraints, such as limited computational resources and network bandwidth. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates some challenges by integrating external knowledge bases, inefficient cache management can still result in high retrieval latency and frequent cache updates. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Contextual Caching (ACC) framework that anticipates user needs by proactively caching semantically relevant data for mobile-edge LLMs. ACC utilizes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module to refine cache replacement policies, balancing user context, document similarity, and the overhead associated with cache misses. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC increases cache hit rates to over 80\% after only 11 training episodes, outperforming FIFO, LRU, and semantic-only caching while reducing retrieval latency by up to 40\%. In particular, ACC also reduces local caching overhead (i.e., the cost of updating the cache when a miss occurs) by as much as 55\%, enabling scalable, low-latency LLM services in resource-constrained edge environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) with optimized efficiency and adaptive capabilities-able to respond to changing task demands and dynamic environments-is a strongly desired goal for advancing construction robotics. Such robots can play a critical role in enabling automation, reducing operational carbon footprints, and supporting modular construction processes. Inspired by the adaptive autonomy of living organisms, we introduce interoception, which centers on the robot's internal state representation, as a foundation for developing self-reflection and conscious learning to enable continual learning and adaptability in robotic agents. In this paper, we factorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as "cognitive dissonance" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally occur. We offer a new perspective on how interoception can help build adaptive motion planning in AMRs by integrating the legacy of heuristic costs from grid/graph-based algorithms with recent advances in neuroscience and reinforcement learning. Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from human semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the spatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we design a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with few-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in contextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover collaboration. These "cached" knowledge representations are demonstrated in simulated environments for multi-robot motion planning and stacking tasks. The insights from this study pave the way toward artificial general intelligence in AMRs, fostering their progression from complexity to competence in construction automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is one of the most popular models in the world. However, serving diffusion models at the entire image level faces several problems, especially when there are multiple candidate resolutions. First, image based serving system prevents requests with different resolutions from batching together. On the other hand, requests with hybrid resolutions also indicate diverse locality features, which makes it hard to apply the same cache policy to all of them. To this end, we propose PATCHEDSERVE, A Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid Resolution Diffusion Serving that provides a patch-level management strategy to gather hybrid resolution requests into batches. Specifically, PATCHEDSERVE incorporates a novel patch-based processing workflow, significantly enhancing throughput for hybrid resolution inputs. Furthermore, PATCHEDSERVE designs a patch-level cache reuse policy to fully exploit the redundancy in diffusion. In addition, PATCHEDSERVE features an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm with lightweight online latency prediction, achieving higher SLO satisfaction rates. We show that PATCHEDSERVE can achieve 30.1 % higher SLO satisfaction compared to SOTA diffusion serving system while not hurt the image quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enhanced content management system for disaster scenarios where communication infrastructure is generally compromised. Utilizing a hybrid network of stationary and mobile Micro-UAVs, this system aims to provide crucial content access to isolated communities. In the developed architecture, stationary anchor UAVs, equipped with vertical and lateral links, serve users in individual disaster-affected communities. and mobile micro-ferrying UAVs, with enhanced mobility, extend coverage across multiple such communities. The primary goal is to devise a content dissemination system that dynamically learns caching policies to maximize content accessibility to users left without communication infrastructure. The core contribution is an adaptive content dissemination framework that employs a decentralized Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit learning approach for efficient UAV caching decisions. This approach accounts for geo-temporal variations in content popularity and diverse user demands. Additionally, a Selective Caching Algorithm is proposed to minimize redundant content copies by leveraging inter-UAV information sharing. Through functional verification and performance evaluation, the proposed framework demonstrates improved system performance and adaptability across varying network sizes, micro-UAV swarms, and content popularity distributions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As multicore hardware is becoming increasingly common in real-time systems, traditional scheduling techniques that assume a single worst-case execution time for a task are no longer adequate, since they ignore the impact of shared resources on execution time. When tasks execute concurrently on different cores, their execution times often vary substantially with their allocated budgets of shared resources, such as cache and memory bandwidth. Even under a specific resource allocation, the resource use pattern of a task also changes with time during a job execution. It is therefore important to consider the relationship between multicore resources and execution time in task modeling and scheduling algorithm design.   In this paper, we propose a much more precise execution model for DAG-based real-time tasks that captures the time-varying resource use characteristics of a task under different budgets of shared resources. We present a generative resource profiling algorithm that efficiently predicts, from limited measurement data, the resource profile of a task at any time during its execution under a given resource budget. The generative profiles can then be used to construct the execution models for tasks, using which one can make informed resource allocation decisions. We further introduce a multicore resource allocation and deadline decomposition co-design technique for DAG-based tasks that leverages the generated execution models to jointly allocate resources and deadlines to subtasks, to maximize resource efficiency and schedulability. Our evaluation results show that our generative profiling algorithm achieves high accuracy while being efficient, and that our co-allocation technique substantially improves schedulability compared to a state-of-the-art deadline decomposition method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are widely used across various applications, but their substantial computational requirements pose significant challenges, particularly in terms of HBM bandwidth bottlenecks and inter-device communication overhead. In this paper, we present PRESERVE, a novel prefetching framework designed to optimize LLM inference by overlapping memory reads for model weights and KV-cache with collective communication operations. Through extensive experiments conducted on commercial AI accelerators, we demonstrate up to 1.6x end-to-end speedup on state-of-the-art, open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a design space exploration that identifies the optimal hardware configuration for the proposed method, showing a further 1.25x improvement in performance per cost by selecting the optimal L2 cache size. Our results show that PRESERVE has the potential to mitigate the memory bottlenecks and communication overheads, offering a solution to improve the performance and scalability of the LLM inference systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient key-value (KV) cache compression is critical for scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in long sequences and resource-limited settings. Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. TreeKV consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models have emerged as one of the most widely used architectures for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation. The size of the state-of-the-art models has increased steadily reaching billions of parameters. These huge models are memory hungry and incur significant inference latency even on cutting edge AI-accelerators, such as GPUs. Specifically, the time and memory complexity of the attention operation is quadratic in terms of the total context length, i.e., prompt and output tokens. Thus, several optimizations such as key-value tensor caching and FlashAttention computation have been proposed to deliver the low latency demands of applications relying on such large models. However, these techniques do not cater to the computationally distinct nature of different phases during inference.   To that end, we propose LeanAttention, a scalable technique of computing self-attention for the token-generation phase (decode-phase) of decoder-only transformer models. LeanAttention enables scaling the attention mechanism implementation for the challenging case of long context lengths by re-designing the execution flow for the decode-phase. We identify that the associative property of online softmax can be treated as a reduction operation thus allowing us to parallelize the attention computation over these large context lengths. We extend the "stream-K" style reduction of tiled calculation to self-attention to enable parallel computation resulting in an average of 2.6x attention execution speedup over FlashAttention-2 and up to 8.33x speedup for 512k context lengths.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse GEneral Matrix-matrix Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation in many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on Gustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited cache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic NUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To generate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete cache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator is applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the accumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the matrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of chunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data structures. MAGNUS allows for a hybrid accumulation strategy in which each chunk uses a different accumulator based on an input threshold. We consider two accumulators: an AVX-512 vectorized bitonic sorting algorithm and classical dense accumulation. An OpenMP implementation of MAGNUS is compared with several baselines for a variety of different matrices on three Intel x86 architectures. For matrices from the SuiteSparse collection, MAGNUS is faster than all the baselines in most cases and is orders of magnitude faster than Intel MKL for several matrices. For massive random matrices that model social network graphs, MAGNUS scales to the largest matrix sizes, while the baselines fail to do so. Furthermore, MAGNUS is close to the optimal bound for these matrices, regardless of the matrix size, structure, and density.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel class of jailbreak adversarial attacks on LLMs, termed Task-in-Prompt (TIP) attacks. Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model's prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignments and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large pretrained models can be used as annotators, helping replace or augment crowdworkers and enabling distilling generalist models into smaller specialist models. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, Alchemist, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a 12.9% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately 500x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_\rm{ion}$) of $z>6$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=279 SFGs selected at $z=6.9-7.6$ from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+$\rm{H\beta}$ emission lines ($W_\lambda$) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure $W_\lambda$ photometrically for a sample of N=253 $z=3.2-3.6$ SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median $W_\lambda$, increasing from $W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A}$ in VANDELS to $W_\lambda =540\pm25\,\r{A}$ in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at $z>7$, we find that $W_\lambda$ correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, $M_{ UV}-$faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the $W_\lambda$ distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower $W_\lambda$, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using $W_\lambda$ as a proxy for $\xi_\rm{ion}$, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction ($f_\rm{esc}$), we find a minority of galaxies with high $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $f_\rm{esc}$ (e.g., $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.6$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.15$). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at $z>7$ is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.3$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.05$. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at $z>7$, with no evidence for over or under-production.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have been interpreted as evidence for evolving dark energy. However, this interpretation is strongly dependent on which Type Ia supernova (SN) sample is combined with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The strength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for the Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+ sample. The cosmology inferred from Pantheon+ sample alone is consistent with the Planck LCDM model and shows no preference for evolving dark energy. In contrast, the the DES5Y SN sample favours evolving dark energy and is discrepant with the Planck LCDM model at about the 3 sigma level. Given these difference, it is important to question whether they are caused by systematics in the SN compilations. A comparison of SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations shows evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts. Systematics of this order can bring the DES5Y sample into good agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology and Pantheon+. I comment on a recent paper by the DES collaboration that rejects this possibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding and constructing brain communications that capture dynamic communications across multiple regions is fundamental to modern system neuroscience, yet current methods struggle to find time-varying region-level communications or scale to large neural datasets with long recording durations. We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative modeling of symmetric densities has a range of applications in AI for science, from drug discovery to physics simulations. The existing generative modeling paradigm for invariant densities combines an invariant prior with an equivariant generative process. However, we observe that this technique is not necessary and has several drawbacks resulting from the limitations of equivariant networks. Instead, we propose to model a learned slice of the density so that only one representative element per orbit is learned. To accomplish this, we learn a group-equivariant canonicalization network that maps training samples to a canonical pose and train a non-equivariant generative model over these canonicalized samples. We implement this idea in the context of diffusion models. Our preliminary experimental results on molecular modeling are promising, demonstrating improved sample quality and faster inference time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are significantly longer than the ones seen during training, while enjoying faster inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) has shown that they achieve near-human-level performance at inferring personal data from online texts. With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have shown that embedding a small payload within each spike exchanged between spiking neurons can enhance inference accuracy without increasing energy consumption. To scale neuromorphic computing to larger workloads, split computing - where an SNN is partitioned across two devices - is a promising solution. In such architectures, the device hosting the initial layers must transmit information about the spikes generated by its output neurons to the second device. This establishes a trade-off between the benefits of multi-level spikes, which carry additional payload information, and the communication resources required for transmitting extra bits between devices. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of a neuromorphic wireless split computing architecture that employs multi-level SNNs. We propose digital and analog modulation schemes for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to enable efficient communication. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios reveal performance improvements achieved by multi-level SNN models and provide insights into the optimal payload size as a function of the connection quality between the transmitter and receiver.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a task that detects OOD samples during inference to ensure the safety of deployed models. However, conventional benchmarks have reached performance saturation, making it difficult to compare recent OOD detection methods. To address this challenge, we introduce three novel OOD detection benchmarks that enable a deeper understanding of method characteristics and reflect real-world conditions. First, we present ImageNet-X, designed to evaluate performance under challenging semantic shifts. Second, we propose ImageNet-FS-X for full-spectrum OOD detection, assessing robustness to covariate shifts (feature distribution shifts). Finally, we propose Wilds-FS-X, which extends these evaluations to real-world datasets, offering a more comprehensive testbed. Our experiments reveal that recent CLIP-based OOD detection methods struggle to varying degrees across the three proposed benchmarks, and none of them consistently outperforms the others. We hope the community goes beyond specific benchmarks and includes more challenging conditions reflecting real-world scenarios. The code is https://github.com/hoshi23/OOD-X-Benchmarks.

However, recent research has largely concluded that current MIA methods do not work on LLMs. Even when they seem to work, it is usually because of the ill-designed experimental setup where other shortcut features enable "cheating." In this work, we argue that MIA still works on LLMs, but only when multiple documents are presented for testing. We construct new benchmarks that measure the MIA performances at a continuous scale of data samples, from sentences (n-grams) to a collection of documents (multiple chunks of tokens). To validate the efficacy of current MIA approaches at greater scales, we adapt a recent work on Dataset Inference (DI) for the task of binary membership detection that aggregates paragraph-level MIA features to enable MIA at document and collection of documents level. This baseline achieves the first successful MIA on pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing effective prompts can empower LLMs to understand user preferences and provide recommendations with intent comprehension and knowledge utilization capabilities. Nevertheless, recent studies predominantly concentrate on task-wise prompting, developing fixed prompt templates shared across all users in a given recommendation task (e.g., rating or ranking). Although convenient, task-wise prompting overlooks individual user differences, leading to inaccurate analysis of user interests. In this work, we introduce the concept of instance-wise prompting, aiming at personalizing discrete prompts for individual users. Toward this end, we propose Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) to realize it automatically. To improve efficiency and quality, RPP personalizes prompts at the sentence level rather than searching in the vast vocabulary word-by-word. Specifically, RPP breaks down the prompt into four patterns, tailoring patterns based on multi-agent and combining them. Then the personalized prompts interact with LLMs (environment) iteratively, to boost LLMs' recommending performance (reward). In addition to RPP, to improve the scalability of action space, our proposal of RPP+ dynamically refines the selected actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of RPP/RPP+ over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods, underscoring the significance of instance-wise prompting in LLMs for recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/maowenyu-11/RPP.

Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern recording techniques enable neuroscientists to simultaneously study neural activity across large populations of neurons, with capturing predictor-dependent correlations being a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Moreover, the fact that input covariates often lie in restricted subdomains, according to experimental settings, makes inference even more challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a set of nonparametric mean-covariance regression models for high-dimensional neural activity with restricted inputs. These models reduce the dimensionality of neural responses by employing a lower-dimensional latent factor model, where both factor loadings and latent factors are predictor-dependent, to jointly model mean and covariance across covariates. The smoothness of neural activity across experimental conditions is modeled nonparametrically using two Gaussian processes (GPs), applied to both loading basis and latent factors. Additionally, to account for the covariates lying in restricted subspace, we incorporate graph information into the covariance structure. To flexibly infer the model, we use an MCMC algorithm to sample from posterior distributions. After validating and studying the properties of proposed methods by simulations, we apply them to two neural datasets (local field potential and neural spiking data) to demonstrate the usage of models for continuous and counting observations. Overall, the proposed methods provide a framework to jointly model covariate-dependent mean and covariance in high dimensional neural data, especially when the covariates lie in restricted domains. The framework is general and can be easily adapted to various applications beyond neuroscience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) can deteriorate in accuracy when deployment data differs from training data. While performing online training at all timesteps can improve accuracy, it is computationally expensive. We propose DecTrain, a new algorithm that decides when to train a monocular depth DNN online using self-supervision with low overhead. To make the decision at each timestep, DecTrain compares the cost of training with the predicted accuracy gain. We evaluate DecTrain on out-of-distribution data, and find DecTrain maintains accuracy compared to online training at all timesteps, while training only 44% of the time on average. We also compare the recovery of a low inference cost DNN using DecTrain and a more generalizable high inference cost DNN on various sequences. DecTrain recovers the majority (97%) of the accuracy gain of online training at all timesteps while reducing computation compared to the high inference cost DNN which recovers only 66%. With an even smaller DNN, we achieve 89% recovery while reducing computation by 56%. DecTrain enables low-cost online training for a smaller DNN to have competitive accuracy with a larger, more generalizable DNN at a lower overall computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose an adaptive importance sampling scheme for Gaussian approximations of intractable posteriors. Optimization-based approximations like variational inference can be too inaccurate while existing Monte Carlo methods can be too slow. Therefore, we propose a hybrid where, at each iteration, the Monte Carlo effective sample size can be guaranteed at a fixed computational cost by interpolating between natural-gradient variational inference and importance sampling. The amount of damping in the updates adapts to the posterior and guarantees the effective sample size. Gaussianity enables the use of Stein's lemma to obtain gradient-based optimization in the highly damped variational inference regime and a reduction of Monte Carlo error for undamped adaptive importance sampling. The result is a generic, embarrassingly parallel and adaptive posterior approximation method. Numerical studies on simulated and real data show its competitiveness with other, less general methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Representation Misdirection (RM) and variants are established large language model (LLM) unlearning methods with state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we show that RM methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in RM models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation -- a model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of RM methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of RM models while enhancing the unlearning performances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs) have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons' spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by generating more informative and discriminative latent representations, improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in neuroscience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Literature reviews play a crucial role in scientific research for understanding the current state of research, identifying gaps, and guiding future studies on specific topics. However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs), to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel prompt-based algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relations between concepts from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes concepts and relations from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, further revealing promising applications of LLMs in scientific research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) prompts the development of multi-modal agents, which are used as a controller to call external tools, providing a feasible way to solve practical tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of image editing, three core challenges persist: controllability, background preservation, and efficiency. Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities and can quickly adapt to downstream tasks through prompt fine-tuning. Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.

This paper presents Synthetic Anomaly Monitoring (SAM), an innovative approach that applies synthetic control methods from causal inference to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection processes. By modeling normal behavior through the treatment of each feature as a control unit, SAM identifies anomalies as deviations within this causal framework. We conducted extensive experiments comparing SAM with established benchmark models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), across five diverse datasets, including Credit Card Fraud, HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010, and KDD Cup 1999, among others. Our results demonstrate that SAM consistently delivers robust performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for real-time anomaly detection in dynamic and complex environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.

Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications. The RSTeller dataset is available at https://github.com/SlytherinGe/RSTeller.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are crucial in the field of artificial intelligence and are widely used in downstream tasks, such as question-answering (QA). The construction of KGs typically requires significant effort from domain experts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used for Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). However, most existing approaches focus on a local perspective, extracting knowledge triplets from individual sentences or documents, missing a fusion process to combine the knowledge in a global KG. This work introduces Graphusion, a zero-shot KGC framework from free text. It contains three steps: in Step 1, we extract a list of seed entities using topic modeling to guide the final KG includes the most relevant entities; in Step 2, we conduct candidate triplet extraction using LLMs; in Step 3, we design the novel fusion module that provides a global view of the extracted knowledge, incorporating entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. Results show that Graphusion achieves scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 for entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively. Moreover, we showcase how Graphusion could be applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain and validate it in an educational scenario. Specifically, we introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified benchmark for QA, comprising six tasks and a total of 1,200 QA pairs. Using the Graphusion-constructed KG, we achieve a significant improvement on the benchmark, for example, a 9.2% accuracy improvement on sub-graph completion.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> "Jailbreak" is a major safety concern of Large Language Models (LLMs), which occurs when malicious prompts lead LLMs to produce harmful outputs, raising issues about the reliability and safety of LLMs. Therefore, an effective evaluation of jailbreaks is very crucial to develop its mitigation strategies. However, our research reveals that many jailbreaks identified by current evaluations may actually be hallucinations-erroneous outputs that are mistaken for genuine safety breaches. This finding suggests that some perceived vulnerabilities might not represent actual threats, indicating a need for more precise red teaming benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Concept-based explanations work by mapping complex model computations to human-understandable concepts. Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive empirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent rankings of explanation methods. Code available at https://github.com/AnonymousConSim/ConSim.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a new regression method that relates the mean of an outcome variable to covariates, under the "adverse condition" that a distress variable falls in its tail. This allows to tailor classical mean regressions to adverse scenarios, which receive increasing interest in economics and finance, among many others. In the terminology of the systemic risk literature, our method can be interpreted as a regression for the Marginal Expected Shortfall. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the new models, show consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator, and propose feasible inference under weak conditions that allow for cross-sectional and time series applications. Simulations verify the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations of the two-step estimator. Two empirical applications show that our regressions under adverse conditions are a valuable tool in such diverse fields as the study of the relation between systemic risk and asset price bubbles, and dissecting macroeconomic growth vulnerabilities into individual components.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as a crucial step for log analysis. Despite a variety of log parsers that have been proposed, their performance on evolving log data remains unsatisfactory due to reliance on human-crafted rules or learning-based models with limited training data. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong abilities in understanding natural language and code, making it promising to apply LLMs for log parsing. Consequently, several studies have proposed LLM-based log parsers. However, LLMs may produce inaccurate templates, and existing LLM-based log parsers directly use the template generated by the LLM as the parsing result, hindering the accuracy of log parsing. Furthermore, these log parsers depend heavily on historical log data as demonstrations, which poses challenges in maintaining accuracy when dealing with scarce historical log data or evolving log data. To address these challenges, we propose AdaParser, an effective and adaptive log parsing framework using LLMs with self-generated in-context learning (SG-ICL) and self-correction. To facilitate accurate log parsing, AdaParser incorporates a novel component, a template corrector, which utilizes the LLM to correct potential parsing errors in the templates it generates. In addition, AdaParser maintains a dynamic candidate set composed of previously generated templates as demonstrations to adapt evolving log data. Extensive experiments on public large-scale datasets indicate that AdaParser outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, even in zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, when integrated with different LLMs, AdaParser consistently enhances the performance of the utilized LLMs by a large margin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Role-play in large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to generate contextually relevant and high-quality responses by simulating diverse cognitive perspectives. However, our study identifies significant risks associated with this technique. First, we demonstrate that autotuning, a method used to auto-select models' roles based on the question, can lead to the generation of harmful outputs, even when the model is tasked with adopting neutral roles. Second, we investigate how different roles affect the likelihood of generating biased or harmful content. Through testing on benchmarks containing stereotypical and harmful questions, we find that role-play consistently amplifies the risk of biased outputs. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of both role simulation and tuning processes when deploying LLMs in sensitive or high-stakes contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for preference alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response is treated as a single arm, ignoring the importance differences between tokens, which may affect optimization efficiency and make it difficult to achieve optimal results. In this work, we propose that the optimal data for DPO has equal expected rewards for each token in winning and losing responses, as there is no difference in token importance. However, since the optimal dataset is unavailable in practice, we propose using the original dataset for importance sampling to achieve unbiased optimization. Accordingly, we propose a token-level importance sampling DPO objective named TIS-DPO that assigns importance weights to each token based on its reward. Inspired by previous works, we estimate the token importance weights using the difference in prediction probabilities from a pair of contrastive LLMs. We explore three methods to construct these contrastive LLMs: (1) guiding the original LLM with contrastive prompts, (2) training two separate LLMs using winning and losing responses, and (3) performing forward and reverse DPO training with winning and losing responses. Experiments show that TIS-DPO significantly outperforms various baseline methods on harmlessness and helpfulness alignment and summarization tasks. We also visualize the estimated weights, demonstrating their ability to identify key token positions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to face hallucination issues due to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected in the decision-making process of LLM Agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collaborative learning of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a new paradigm for utilizing private data from different parties to guarantee efficiency and privacy. Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference. Code is available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, are considered to learn the latent distributions within large-scale web-crawl datasets and accomplish natural language processing (NLP) tasks by predicting the next token. However, this mechanism of latent distribution modeling lacks quantitative understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language dataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token transition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like language model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree''). Our experiments show that different GPT models trained on the same dataset exhibit significant structural similarity in GPT-Tree visualization, and larger models converge more closely to the Data-Tree. More than 87\% GPT output tokens can be recalled by Data-Tree. These findings may confirm that the reasoning process of LLMs is more likely to be probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, as each model inference seems to find a context pattern with maximum probability from the Data-Tree. Furthermore, we provide deeper insights into issues such as hallucination, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and token bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, generated impersonation posts where 93.9% of them were deemed authentic, and boosted click rate of phishing links in spear phishing emails by 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fingerprinting refers to the process of identifying underlying Machine Learning (ML) models of AI Systemts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), by analyzing their unique characteristics or patterns, much like a human fingerprint. The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, self-supervised pre-training methods have gained significant traction in learning high-level information from raw speech. Among these methods, HuBERT has demonstrated SOTA performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, HuBERT's performance lags behind data2vec due to disparities in pre-training strategies. In this paper, we propose (i) a Swap method to address pre-training and inference mismatch observed in HuBERT and (ii) incorporates Multicluster masked prediction loss for more effective utilization of the models capacity. The resulting method is, MS-HuBERT, an end-to-end self-supervised pre-training method for learning robust speech representations. It beats vanilla HuBERT on the ASR Librispeech benchmark on average by a 5% margin when evaluated on different finetuning splits. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings obtained during pre-training encode essential information for improving performance of content based tasks such as ASR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in product bundling have leveraged multimodal information through sophisticated encoders, but remain constrained by limited semantic understanding and a narrow scope of knowledge. Therefore, some attempts employ In-context Learning (ICL) to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for their extensive knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. However, these efforts are inadequate in understanding mulitmodal data and exploiting LLMs' knowledge for product bundling. To bridge the gap, we introduce Bundle-MLLM, a novel framework that fine-tunes LLMs through a hybrid item tokenization approach within a well-designed optimization strategy. Specifically, we integrate textual, media, and relational data into a unified tokenization, introducing a soft separation token to distinguish between textual and non-textual tokens. Additionally, a streamlined yet powerful multimodal fusion module is employed to embed all non-textual features into a single, informative token, significantly boosting efficiency. To tailor product bundling tasks for LLMs, we reformulate the task as a multiple-choice question with candidate items as options. We further propose a progressive optimization strategy that fine-tunes LLMs for disentangled objectives: 1) learning bundle patterns and 2) enhancing multimodal semantic understanding specific to product bundling. Extensive experiments on four datasets across two domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal variational autoencoders have demonstrated their ability to learn the relationships between different modalities by mapping them into a latent representation. Their design and capacity to perform any-to-any conditional and unconditional generation make them appealing. However, different variants of multimodal VAEs often suffer from generating low-quality output, particularly when complex modalities such as images are involved. In addition to that, they frequently exhibit low coherence among the generated modalities when sampling from the joint distribution. To address these limitations, we propose a new variant of the multimodal VAE ELBO that incorporates a better decoder using a diffusion generative model. The diffusion decoder enables the model to learn complex modalities and generate high-quality outputs. The multimodal model can also seamlessly integrate with a standard feed-forward decoder for different types of modality, facilitating end-to-end training and inference. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary score-based model to enhance the unconditional generation capabilities of our proposed approach. This approach addresses the limitations imposed by conventional multimodal VAEs and opens up new possibilities to improve multimodal generation tasks. Our model provides state-of-the-art results compared to other multimodal VAEs in different datasets with higher coherence and superior quality in the generated modalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.

To advance this task, we introduce TESRBench, a comprehensive benchmark for temporal event sequence retrieval (TESR) from textual descriptions. TESRBench includes diverse real-world datasets with synthesized and reviewed textual descriptions, providing a strong foundation for evaluating retrieval performance and addressing challenges in this domain. Building on this benchmark, we propose TPP-Embedding, a novel model for embedding and retrieving event sequences. The model leverages the TPP-LLM framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal point processes (TPPs) to encode both event texts and times. By pooling representations and applying a contrastive loss, it unifies temporal dynamics and event semantics in a shared embedding space, aligning sequence-level embeddings of event sequences and their descriptions. TPP-Embedding demonstrates superior performance over baseline models across TESRBench datasets, establishing it as a powerful solution for the temporal event sequence retrieval task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted considerable attention, which transfers knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Reducing inter-domain differences has always been a crucial factor to improve performance in UDA, especially for tasks where there is a large gap between source and target domains. To this end, we propose a novel style-aware feature fusion method (SAFF) to bridge the large domain gap and transfer knowledge while alleviating the loss of class-discriminative information. Inspired by the human transitive inference and learning ability, a novel style-aware self-intermediate domain (SSID) is investigated to link two seemingly unrelated concepts through a series of intermediate auxiliary synthesized concepts. Specifically, we propose a novel learning strategy of SSID, which selects samples from both source and target domains as anchors, and then randomly fuses the object and style features of these anchors to generate labeled and style-rich intermediate auxiliary features for knowledge transfer. Moreover, we design an external memory bank to store and update specified labeled features to obtain stable class features and class-wise style features. Based on the proposed memory bank, the intra- and inter-domain loss functions are designed to improve the class recognition ability and feature compatibility, respectively. Meanwhile, we simulate the rich latent feature space of SSID by infinite sampling and the convergence of the loss function by mathematical theory. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly used domain adaptive benchmarks to evaluate the proposed SAFF, and the experimental results show that the proposed SAFF can be easily combined with different backbone networks and obtain better performance as a plug-in-plug-out module.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management.   Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications.   This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis is gaining attention in various fields, including software engineering, where qualitative methods are essential for understanding human and social factors. This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations. While LLMs show promise in supporting qualitative analysis, human expertise remains crucial for interpreting data, and ongoing exploration of best practices will be vital for their successful integration into empirical software engineering research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has brought new vitality into various domains, generating substantial social and economic benefits. However, this swift advancement has also introduced new vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to produce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a significant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. Our SIJ method achieves near 100\% attack success rates on five well-known open-source LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As software systems become more complex and configurable, more performance problems tend to arise from the configuration designs. This has caused some configuration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from their original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies, namely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be deeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult, not only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the configuration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible configurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy runtime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is limited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle. In this paper, we seek to achieve significantly faster CPBug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing at both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle estimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works with different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural language models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle while, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being CPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched can be prioritized. Experiments on several widely-used systems of different versions reveal that NDP can, in general, better predict CPBug type in 87% cases and find more CPBugs with up to 88.88x testing efficiency speedup over the state-of-the-art tools.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluator and optimization method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reranking is a critical component in recommender systems, playing an essential role in refining the output of recommendation algorithms. Traditional reranking models have focused predominantly on accuracy, but modern applications demand consideration of additional criteria such as diversity and fairness. Existing reranking approaches often fail to harmonize these diverse criteria effectively at the model level. Moreover, these models frequently encounter challenges with scalability and personalization due to their complexity and the varying significance of different reranking criteria in diverse scenarios. In response, we introduce a comprehensive reranking framework enhanced by LLM, designed to seamlessly integrate various reranking criteria while maintaining scalability and facilitating personalized recommendations. This framework employs a fully connected graph structure, allowing the LLM to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. A customizable input mechanism is also integrated, enabling the tuning of the language model's focus to meet specific reranking needs. We validate our approach using three popular public datasets, where our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art reranking models in balancing multiple criteria.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The spectral density matrix is a fundamental object of interest in time series analysis, and it encodes both contemporary and dynamic linear relationships between component processes of the multivariate system. In this paper we develop novel inference procedures for the spectral density matrix in the high-dimensional setting. Specifically, we introduce a new global testing procedure to test the nullity of the cross-spectral density for a given set of frequencies and across pairs of component indices. For the first time, both Gaussian approximation and parametric bootstrap methodologies are employed to conduct inference for a high-dimensional parameter formulated in the frequency domain, and new technical tools are developed to provide asymptotic guarantees of the size accuracy and power for global testing. We further propose a multiple testing procedure for simultaneously testing the nullity of the cross-spectral density at a given set of frequencies. The method is shown to control the false discovery rate. Both numerical simulations and a real data illustration demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed testing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code-switching (CS) refers to the switching of languages within a speech signal and results in language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address language confusion, we introduce a novel language alignment loss into ASR training to align acoustic features to pseudo-language labels learned from the ASR decoder. This approach enables frame-level language identification without the need for frame-level language annotations. To further tackle the complex token alternatives for language modeling in bilingual scenarios, we propose to employ large language models via a generative error correction method. A linguistic hint, which is derived from LAL outputs and decoded hypotheses, is introduced to guide the prompting and enhance the LLM-based generative error correction for CS-ASR. The proposed methods are evaluated on the SEAME dataset and data from the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge. The incorporation of the proposed language alignment loss improves the CS-ASR performance for both hybrid CTC/attention and Whisper models on both datasets, with only a negligible increase in the number of parameters. This work also highlights the efficacy of language alignment loss in balancing primary-language-dominant bilingual data during training, with an 8.6% relative improvement on the ASRU dataset compared to the baseline model. Performance evaluation using large language models reveals the advantage of the linguistic hint by achieving 14.1% and 5.5% relative improvement on test sets of the ASRU and SEAME datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Renormalization group theory is a powerful and intriguing technique with a wide range of applications. One of the main successes of renormalization group theory is the description of continuous phase transitions and the development of scaling theory. Most courses on phase transitions focus on scaling and critical exponents, while less attention is paid to universality, renormalization group flow, and the existence of a unique fixed point, which are the ultimate reasons why scaling theory is so effective in describing continuous phase transitions. We use a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and real space renormalization group theory to determine the renormalization group flow and to show the existence of a universal fixed point in the context of the ferromagnetic Ising model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.

The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across the digits of the answer rather than normally around its numeric value. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of social media has made the spread of misinformation easier. In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence has resulted in the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to produce text that closely resembles human communication. These models have been seamlessly integrated into diverse applications, enabling interactive and responsive communication across multiple platforms. The potential utility of chatbots transcends these traditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can offer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In this study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based chatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is meticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a conventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment code upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing, thereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for research purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as needed; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without the necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting that our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but is not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval research or interacting with chat bot agents in general.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of the current state of Healthcare Knowledge Graphs (HKGs), including their construction, utilization models, and applications across various healthcare and biomedical research domains. We thoroughly analyzed existing literature on HKGs, covering their construction methodologies, utilization techniques, and applications in basic science research, pharmaceutical research and development, clinical decision support, and public health. The review encompasses both model-free and model-based utilization approaches and the integration of HKGs with large language models (LLMs). We searched Google Scholar for relevant papers on HKGs and classified them into the following topics: HKG construction, HKG utilization, and their downstream applications in various domains. We also discussed their special challenges and the promise for future work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the ability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and respond accordingly. We identify and demonstrate that the loss of context awareness, particularly in open-source models, occurs in instruction fine-tuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the performance decline is associated with a bias toward different roles learned during conversational instruction fine-tuning. We demonstrate this correlation by visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is applied and manually steering the attention heads. The bias can be learned from training examples that align with the model's internal knowledge and rely less on the user-provided context to generate correct responses. Based on these observations, we propose a metric to identify context-dependent examples from general instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to preserve context awareness after SFT. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent downstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our method effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising general instruction-following capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient video tokenization remains a key bottleneck in learning general purpose vision models that are capable of processing long video sequences. Prevailing approaches are restricted to encoding videos to a fixed number of tokens, where too few tokens will result in overly lossy encodings, and too many tokens will result in prohibitively long sequence lengths. In this work, we introduce ElasticTok, a method that conditions on prior frames to adaptively encode a frame into a variable number of tokens. To enable this in a computationally scalable way, we propose a masking technique that drops a random number of tokens at the end of each frames's token encoding. During inference, ElasticTok can dynamically allocate tokens when needed -- more complex data can leverage more tokens, while simpler data only needs a few tokens. Our empirical evaluations on images and video demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficient token usage, paving the way for future development of more powerful multimodal models, world models, and agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recognition of features in satellite imagery (forests, swimming pools, etc.) depends strongly on the spatial scale of the concept and therefore the resolution of the images. This poses two challenges: Which resolution is best suited for recognizing a given concept, and where and when should the costlier higher-resolution (HR) imagery be acquired?   We present a novel scheme to address these challenges by introducing three components: (1) A technique to distill knowledge from models trained on HR imagery to recognition models that operate on imagery of lower resolution (LR), (2) a sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement, and (3) an LLM-based approach for inferring concept "scale". With these components we present a system to efficiently perform scale-aware recognition in satellite imagery, improving accuracy over single-scale inference while following budget constraints. Our novel approach offers up to a 26.3% improvement over entirely HR baselines, using 76.3% fewer HR images.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.

We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90% across 8 different private attributes. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model. Our results show the possibility of reducing privacy leakage by more than half with limited impact on utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly with users frequently asking questions to chatbots. In the time when information is readily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive abilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such challenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to direct answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset, WikiHint, which is based on Wikipedia and includes 5,000 hints created for 1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint generation in answer-aware and answeragnostic contexts. We assess the effectiveness of the hints with human participants who answer questions with and without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight evaluation method, HintRank, to evaluate and rank hints in both answeraware and answer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate more effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions generally improves quality of generated hints, and (c) encoder-based models perform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are remarkably efficient across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the LLMs' generalization capabilities remains elusive. In our paper, we approach this task by drawing an equivalence between autoregressive transformer-based language models and Markov chains defined on a finite state space. This allows us to study the multi-step inference mechanism of LLMs from first principles. We relate the obtained results to the pathological behavior observed with LLMs such as repetitions and incoherent replies with high temperature. Finally, we leverage the proposed formalization to derive pre-training and in-context learning generalization bounds for LLMs under realistic data and model assumptions. Experiments with the most recent Llama and Gemma herds of models show that our theory correctly captures their behavior in practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement. The project page is here: remote-bmxs.netlify.app

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to memorize structured knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which general-purpose pre-trained LLMs retain and correctly reproduce concept identifier (ID)-label associations from publicly available ontologies. We conduct a systematic evaluation across multiple ontological resources, including the Gene Ontology, Uberon, Wikidata, and ICD-10, using LLMs such as Pythia-12B, Gemini-1.5-Flash, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our findings reveal that only a small fraction of ontological concepts is accurately memorized, with GPT-4 demonstrating the highest performance. To understand why certain concepts are memorized more effectively than others, we analyze the relationship between memorization accuracy and concept popularity on the Web. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the frequency of a concept's occurrence online and the likelihood of accurately retrieving its ID from the label. This suggests that LLMs primarily acquire such knowledge through indirect textual exposure rather than directly from structured ontological resources. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to quantify prediction invariance, demonstrating that the stability of model responses across variations in prompt language and temperature settings can serve as a proxy for estimating memorization robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a new framework for constructing congruence closure of a finite set of ground equations over uninterpreted symbols and interpreted symbols for the group axioms. In this framework, ground equations are flattened into certain forms by introducing new constants, and a completion procedure is performed on ground flat equations. The proposed completion procedure uses equational inference rules and constructs a ground convergent rewrite system for congruence closure with such interpreted symbols. If the completion procedure terminates, then it yields a decision procedure for the word problem for a finite set of ground equations with respect to the group axioms. This paper also provides a sufficient terminating condition of the completion procedure for constructing a ground convergent rewrite system from ground flat equations containing interpreted symbols for the group axioms. In addition, this paper presents a new method for constructing congruence closure of a finite set of ground equations containing interpreted symbols for the semigroup, monoid, and the multiple disjoint sets of group axioms, respectively, using the proposed framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Polarization of starlight induced by dust grains aligned with the magnetic field (hereafter B-field) is widely used to measure the two-dimensional B-fields projected onto the plane-of-sky. Here, we introduce a new method to infer three-dimensional B-fields using starlight polarization. We show that the inclination angle or line-of-sight (LOS) component of B-fields can be constrained by the starlight polarization efficiency from observations, the alignment degree provided by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory, and the effect of B-field tangling. We first perform synthetic observations of starlight polarization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code incorporating the modern MRAT theory. We test the new technique with synthetic observations and find that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately determined by the synthetic starlight polarization efficiency once the effects of grain alignment, dust properties, and B-field fluctuations are well characterized. The technique can provide an accurate constraint on B-field inclination angles using optical polarization in low-density regions $A_{\rm V}< 3$ with efficient MRAT alignment, whereas the technique can infer further to high-density regions with significant alignment loss at $A_{\rm V} \sim 8 - 30$ by using near-infrared polarization. Our new technique unlocks the full potential of tracing 3D B-fields and constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics on multiple scales of the diffuse interstellar medium and star-forming regions using multi-wavelength starlight polarization observations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spiking neural network (SNN), as the next generation of artificial neural network (ANN), offer a closer mimicry of natural neural networks and hold promise for significant improvements in computational efficiency. However, the current SNN is trained to infer over a fixed duration, overlooking the potential of dynamic inference in SNN. In this paper, we strengthen the marriage between SNN and event-driven processing with a proposal to consider a cutoff in SNN, which can terminate SNN anytime during inference to achieve efficient inference. Two novel optimisation techniques are presented to achieve inference efficient SNN: a Top-K cutoff and a regularisation.The proposed regularisation influences the training process, optimising SNN for the cutoff, while the Top-K cutoff technique optimises the inference phase. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on multiple benchmark frame-based datasets, such asCIFAR10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, and event-based datasets, including CIFAR10-DVS, N-Caltech101 and DVS128 Gesture. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in both ANN-to-SNN conversion and direct training, enabling SNNs to require 1.76 to 2.76x fewer timesteps for CIFAR-10, while achieving 1.64 to 1.95x fewer timesteps across all event-based datasets, with near-zero accuracy loss. These findings affirms the compatibility and potential benefits of our techniques in enhancing accuracy and reducing inference latency when integrated with existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) famously exhibit emergent in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks using few-shot examples provided as a prompt, without updating the model's weights. Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ys-zong/VL-ICL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and generating natural language content. An increasing number of services offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs demonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text classification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexity, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are investigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to find an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance with guarantees.   In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that maximizes the overall prediction accuracy. We show that prediction accuracy is non-decreasing and non-submodular and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. By leveraging a submodular function that upper bounds prediction accuracy, we develop an algorithm called ThriftLLM and prove that it achieves an instance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. In addition, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for text classification and entity matching queries on multiple real-world datasets against various baselines in our extensive experimental evaluation, while using a relatively lower cost budget, strongly supporting the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe a counter-intuitive fact that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to LLMs' limited input context length, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphSOS (Graph Sampling and Order Selection). This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphSOS improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in answering medical questions, such as achieving passing scores on medical licensing examinations. However, medical board exams or general clinical questions do not capture the complexity of realistic clinical cases. Moreover, the lack of reference explanations means we cannot easily evaluate the reasoning of model decisions, a crucial component of supporting doctors in making complex medical decisions. To address these challenges, we construct two new datasets: JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets.\footnote{Datasets and code are available at \url{https://github.com/HanjieChen/ChallengeClinicalQA}.} JAMA Clinical Challenge consists of questions based on challenging clinical cases, while Medbullets comprises simulated clinical questions. Both datasets are structured as multiple-choice question-answering tasks, accompanied by expert-written explanations. We evaluate seven LLMs on the two datasets using various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our datasets are harder than previous benchmarks. In-depth automatic and human evaluations of model-generated explanations provide insights into the promise and deficiency of LLMs for explainable medical QA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Covariance matrix estimation, a classical statistical topic, poses significant challenges when the sample size is comparable to or smaller than the number of features. In this paper, we frame covariance matrix estimation as a compound decision problem and apply an optimal decision rule to estimate covariance parameters. To approximate this rule, we introduce an algorithm that integrates jackknife techniques with machine learning regression methods. This algorithm exhibits adaptability across diverse scenarios without relying on assumptions about data distribution. Simulation results and gene network inference from an RNA-seq experiment in mice demonstrate that our approach either matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art methods

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling test-time compute is a promising axis for improving LLM capabilities. However, test-time compute can be scaled in a variety of ways, and effectively combining different approaches remains an active area of research. Here, we explore this problem in the context of solving real-world GitHub issues from the SWE-bench dataset. Our system, named CodeMonkeys, allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by jointly generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit. We sample many of these multi-turn trajectories for every issue to generate a collection of candidate edits. This approach lets us scale "serial" test-time compute by increasing the number of iterations per trajectory and "parallel" test-time compute by increasing the number of trajectories per problem. With parallel scaling, we can amortize up-front costs across multiple downstream samples, allowing us to identify relevant codebase context using the simple method of letting an LLM read every file. In order to select between candidate edits, we combine voting using model-generated tests with a final multi-turn trajectory dedicated to selection. Overall, CodeMonkeys resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD. Our selection method can also be used to combine candidates from different sources. Selecting over an ensemble of edits from existing top SWE-bench Verified submissions obtains a score of 66.2% and outperforms the best member of the ensemble on its own. We fully release our code and data at https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/pubs/codemonkeys.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel class of jailbreak adversarial attacks on LLMs, termed Task-in-Prompt (TIP) attacks. Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model's prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignments and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large pretrained models can be used as annotators, helping replace or augment crowdworkers and enabling distilling generalist models into smaller specialist models. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, Alchemist, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a 12.9% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately 500x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we present and evaluate SELMA, a Speech-Enabled Language Model for virtual Assistant interactions that integrates audio and text as inputs to a Large Language Model (LLM). SELMA is designed to handle three primary and two auxiliary tasks related to interactions with virtual assistants simultaneously within a single end-to-end model. We employ low-rank adaptation modules for parameter-efficient training of both the audio encoder and the LLM. Additionally, we implement a feature pooling strategy enabling the system to recognize global patterns and improve accuracy on tasks less reliant on individual sequence elements. Experimental results on Voice Trigger (VT) detection, Device-Directed Speech Detection (DDSD), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), demonstrate that our approach both simplifies the typical input processing pipeline of virtual assistants significantly and also improves performance compared to dedicated models for each individual task. SELMA yields relative Equal-Error Rate improvements of 64% on the VT detection task, and 22% on DDSD, while also achieving word error rates close to the baseline.

Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) has shown that they achieve near-human-level performance at inferring personal data from online texts. With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Membership inference attacks (MIA) attempt to verify the membership of a given data sample in the training set for a model. MIA has become relevant in recent years, following the rapid development of large language models (LLM). Many are concerned about the usage of copyrighted materials for training them and call for methods for detecting such usage. However, recent research has largely concluded that current MIA methods do not work on LLMs. Even when they seem to work, it is usually because of the ill-designed experimental setup where other shortcut features enable "cheating." In this work, we argue that MIA still works on LLMs, but only when multiple documents are presented for testing. We construct new benchmarks that measure the MIA performances at a continuous scale of data samples, from sentences (n-grams) to a collection of documents (multiple chunks of tokens). To validate the efficacy of current MIA approaches at greater scales, we adapt a recent work on Dataset Inference (DI) for the task of binary membership detection that aggregates paragraph-level MIA features to enable MIA at document and collection of documents level. This baseline achieves the first successful MIA on pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital agents are increasingly employed to automate tasks in interactive digital environments such as web pages, software applications, and operating systems. While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data. These improvements further translate to significant gains in both web and OS agent downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Designing effective prompts can empower LLMs to understand user preferences and provide recommendations with intent comprehension and knowledge utilization capabilities. Nevertheless, recent studies predominantly concentrate on task-wise prompting, developing fixed prompt templates shared across all users in a given recommendation task (e.g., rating or ranking). Although convenient, task-wise prompting overlooks individual user differences, leading to inaccurate analysis of user interests. In this work, we introduce the concept of instance-wise prompting, aiming at personalizing discrete prompts for individual users. Toward this end, we propose Reinforced Prompt Personalization (RPP) to realize it automatically. To improve efficiency and quality, RPP personalizes prompts at the sentence level rather than searching in the vast vocabulary word-by-word. Specifically, RPP breaks down the prompt into four patterns, tailoring patterns based on multi-agent and combining them. Then the personalized prompts interact with LLMs (environment) iteratively, to boost LLMs' recommending performance (reward). In addition to RPP, to improve the scalability of action space, our proposal of RPP+ dynamically refines the selected actions with LLMs throughout the iterative process. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of RPP/RPP+ over traditional recommender models, few-shot methods, and other prompt-based methods, underscoring the significance of instance-wise prompting in LLMs for recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/maowenyu-11/RPP.

Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep neural networks (DNNs) can deteriorate in accuracy when deployment data differs from training data. While performing online training at all timesteps can improve accuracy, it is computationally expensive. We propose DecTrain, a new algorithm that decides when to train a monocular depth DNN online using self-supervision with low overhead. To make the decision at each timestep, DecTrain compares the cost of training with the predicted accuracy gain. We evaluate DecTrain on out-of-distribution data, and find DecTrain maintains accuracy compared to online training at all timesteps, while training only 44% of the time on average. We also compare the recovery of a low inference cost DNN using DecTrain and a more generalizable high inference cost DNN on various sequences. DecTrain recovers the majority (97%) of the accuracy gain of online training at all timesteps while reducing computation compared to the high inference cost DNN which recovers only 66%. With an even smaller DNN, we achieve 89% recovery while reducing computation by 56%. DecTrain enables low-cost online training for a smaller DNN to have competitive accuracy with a larger, more generalizable DNN at a lower overall computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since its introduction in 2012, the Combined Charging System (CCS) has emerged as the leading technology for EV fast charging in Europe, North America and parts of Asia. The charging communication of CCS is defined by the ISO 15118 standards, which have been improved over the years. Most notably, in 2014, important security features such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and usability enhancements such as Plug and Charge were introduced.   In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study of publicly deployed CCS DC charging stations to capture the state of deployment for different protocol versions and to better understand the attack surface of the EV charging infrastructure. In our evaluation, we examine 325 chargers manufactured between April 2013 and June 2023, and installed as late as May 2024 by 26 manufacturers across 4 European countries. We find that only 12% of the charging stations we analyzed implement TLS at all, leaving all others vulnerable to attacks that have already been demonstrated many years ago. We observe an increasing trend in support for ISO 15118-2 over the years, reaching 70% of chargers manufactured in 2023. We further notice that most chargers use a decade-old firmware for their HomePlug modems, which could contain vulnerabilities that have been patched since. Finally, we discuss design flaws with the Public Key Infrastructure system used in EV charging, and propose changes to improve the adoption and availability of TLS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Representation Misdirection (RM) and variants are established large language model (LLM) unlearning methods with state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we show that RM methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we reframe the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in RM models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose Random Noise Augmentation -- a model and method agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of RM methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of RM models while enhancing the unlearning performances.

Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Literature reviews play a crucial role in scientific research for understanding the current state of research, identifying gaps, and guiding future studies on specific topics. However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs), to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel prompt-based algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relations between concepts from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes concepts and relations from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, further revealing promising applications of LLMs in scientific research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study introduces a novel methodology for voice pathology detection using the publicly available Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database (SVD) database and a robust feature set combining commonly used acoustic handcrafted features with two novel ones: pitch difference (relative variation in fundamental frequency) and a NaN feature (failed fundamental frequency estimation).   We evaluate six machine learning (ML) classifiers - support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost - using grid search for feasible hyperparameters of selected classifiers and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classifier-feature subset combinations for each classifier type are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data.   Our approach achieves outstanding performance, reaching 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectivelly. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data. This advancement demonstrates significant potential for clinical deployment of ML methods, offering a valuable supportive tool for an objective examination of voice pathologies. To enable an easier use of our methodology and to support our claims, we provide a publicly available GitHub repository with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13771573. Finally, we provide a REFORMS checklist to enhance readability, reproducibility and justification of our approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) prompts the development of multi-modal agents, which are used as a controller to call external tools, providing a feasible way to solve practical tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities and can quickly adapt to downstream tasks through prompt fine-tuning. Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern software-defined networks, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems, rely on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered applications running on controllers interfaced with the radio access network. To ensure that these AI applications operate reliably at runtime, they must be properly calibrated before deployment. A promising and theoretically grounded approach to calibration is conformal prediction (CP), which enhances any AI model by transforming it into a provably reliable set predictor that provides error bars for estimates and decisions. CP requires calibration data that matches the distribution of the environment encountered during runtime. However, in practical scenarios, network controllers often have access only to data collected under different contexts -- such as varying traffic patterns and network conditions -- leading to a mismatch between the calibration and runtime distributions. This paper introduces a novel methodology to address this calibration-test distribution shift. The approach leverages meta-learning to develop a zero-shot estimator of distribution shifts, relying solely on contextual information. The proposed method, called meta-learned context-dependent weighted conformal prediction (ML-WCP), enables effective calibration of AI applications without requiring data from the current context. Additionally, it can incorporate data from multiple contexts to further enhance calibration reliability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Warning: Contains harmful model outputs.   Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural models have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse ranking tasks. However, the processes and internal mechanisms along which they determine relevance are still largely unknown. Existing approaches for analyzing neural ranker behavior with respect to IR properties rely either on assessing overall model behavior or employing probing methods that may offer an incomplete understanding of causal mechanisms. To provide a more granular understanding of internal model decision-making processes, we propose the use of causal interventions to reverse engineer neural rankers, and demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be used to isolate components satisfying term-frequency axioms within a ranking model. We identify a group of attention heads that detect duplicate tokens in earlier layers of the model, then communicate with downstream heads to compute overall document relevance. More generally, we propose that this style of mechanistic analysis opens up avenues for reverse engineering the processes neural retrieval models use to compute relevance. This work aims to initiate granular interpretability efforts that will not only benefit retrieval model development and training, but ultimately ensure safer deployment of these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Abundant, well-annotated multimodal data in remote sensing are pivotal for aligning complex visual remote sensing (RS) scenes with human language, enabling the development of specialized vision language models across diverse RS interpretation tasks. However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are crucial in the field of artificial intelligence and are widely used in downstream tasks, such as question-answering (QA). The construction of KGs typically requires significant effort from domain experts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used for Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). However, most existing approaches focus on a local perspective, extracting knowledge triplets from individual sentences or documents, missing a fusion process to combine the knowledge in a global KG. This work introduces Graphusion, a zero-shot KGC framework from free text. It contains three steps: in Step 1, we extract a list of seed entities using topic modeling to guide the final KG includes the most relevant entities; in Step 2, we conduct candidate triplet extraction using LLMs; in Step 3, we design the novel fusion module that provides a global view of the extracted knowledge, incorporating entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. Results show that Graphusion achieves scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 for entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively. Moreover, we showcase how Graphusion could be applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain and validate it in an educational scenario. Specifically, we introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified benchmark for QA, comprising six tasks and a total of 1,200 QA pairs. Using the Graphusion-constructed KG, we achieve a significant improvement on the benchmark, for example, a 9.2% accuracy improvement on sub-graph completion.

However, our research reveals that many jailbreaks identified by current evaluations may actually be hallucinations-erroneous outputs that are mistaken for genuine safety breaches. This finding suggests that some perceived vulnerabilities might not represent actual threats, indicating a need for more precise red teaming benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Concept-based explanations work by mapping complex model computations to human-understandable concepts. Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive empirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent rankings of explanation methods. Code available at https://github.com/AnonymousConSim/ConSim.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as a crucial step for log analysis. Despite a variety of log parsers that have been proposed, their performance on evolving log data remains unsatisfactory due to reliance on human-crafted rules or learning-based models with limited training data. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong abilities in understanding natural language and code, making it promising to apply LLMs for log parsing. Consequently, several studies have proposed LLM-based log parsers. However, LLMs may produce inaccurate templates, and existing LLM-based log parsers directly use the template generated by the LLM as the parsing result, hindering the accuracy of log parsing. Furthermore, these log parsers depend heavily on historical log data as demonstrations, which poses challenges in maintaining accuracy when dealing with scarce historical log data or evolving log data. To address these challenges, we propose AdaParser, an effective and adaptive log parsing framework using LLMs with self-generated in-context learning (SG-ICL) and self-correction. To facilitate accurate log parsing, AdaParser incorporates a novel component, a template corrector, which utilizes the LLM to correct potential parsing errors in the templates it generates. In addition, AdaParser maintains a dynamic candidate set composed of previously generated templates as demonstrations to adapt evolving log data. Extensive experiments on public large-scale datasets indicate that AdaParser outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, even in zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, when integrated with different LLMs, AdaParser consistently enhances the performance of the utilized LLMs by a large margin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Role-play in large language models (LLMs) enhances their ability to generate contextually relevant and high-quality responses by simulating diverse cognitive perspectives. However, our study identifies significant risks associated with this technique. First, we demonstrate that autotuning, a method used to auto-select models' roles based on the question, can lead to the generation of harmful outputs, even when the model is tasked with adopting neutral roles. Second, we investigate how different roles affect the likelihood of generating biased or harmful content. Through testing on benchmarks containing stereotypical and harmful questions, we find that role-play consistently amplifies the risk of biased outputs. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of both role simulation and tuning processes when deploying LLMs in sensitive or high-stakes contexts.

Its modular design consists of a versatile wrapper for RL environments and algorithm libraries, a participant-facing web interface, logging utilities, deployment on popular cloud and participant recruitment platforms. It empowers researchers to study a wide variety of research questions related to the interaction between humans and RL agents, including those related to interactive reward specification and learning, learning from human feedback, action delegation, preference elicitation, user-modeling, and human-AI teaming. The platform is based on a generic interface for human-RL interactions that aims to standardize the field of study on RL in human contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for preference alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response is treated as a single arm, ignoring the importance differences between tokens, which may affect optimization efficiency and make it difficult to achieve optimal results. In this work, we propose that the optimal data for DPO has equal expected rewards for each token in winning and losing responses, as there is no difference in token importance. However, since the optimal dataset is unavailable in practice, we propose using the original dataset for importance sampling to achieve unbiased optimization. Accordingly, we propose a token-level importance sampling DPO objective named TIS-DPO that assigns importance weights to each token based on its reward. Inspired by previous works, we estimate the token importance weights using the difference in prediction probabilities from a pair of contrastive LLMs. We explore three methods to construct these contrastive LLMs: (1) guiding the original LLM with contrastive prompts, (2) training two separate LLMs using winning and losing responses, and (3) performing forward and reverse DPO training with winning and losing responses. Experiments show that TIS-DPO significantly outperforms various baseline methods on harmlessness and helpfulness alignment and summarization tasks. We also visualize the estimated weights, demonstrating their ability to identify key token positions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to face hallucination issues due to the data they trained on often containing human bias; whether this is reflected in the decision-making process of LLM Agents remains under-explored. As LLM Agents are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we utilize LLM Agents' systematic hallucinations to mirror human cognitive biases, thus exhibiting irrational social intelligence? In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties. Additionally, the CogMir framework demonstrates its potential as a valuable platform for encouraging more research into the social intelligence of LLM Agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Collaborative learning of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a new paradigm for utilizing private data from different parties to guarantee efficiency and privacy. Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference. Code is available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, are considered to learn the latent distributions within large-scale web-crawl datasets and accomplish natural language processing (NLP) tasks by predicting the next token. However, this mechanism of latent distribution modeling lacks quantitative understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language dataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token transition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like language model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree''). Our experiments show that different GPT models trained on the same dataset exhibit significant structural similarity in GPT-Tree visualization, and larger models converge more closely to the Data-Tree. More than 87\% GPT output tokens can be recalled by Data-Tree. These findings may confirm that the reasoning process of LLMs is more likely to be probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, as each model inference seems to find a context pattern with maximum probability from the Data-Tree. Furthermore, we provide deeper insights into issues such as hallucination, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and token bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have established them as agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with various tools. These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, generated impersonation posts where 93.9% of them were deemed authentic, and boosted click rate of phishing links in spear phishing emails by 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fingerprinting refers to the process of identifying underlying Machine Learning (ML) models of AI Systemts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), by analyzing their unique characteristics or patterns, much like a human fingerprint. The fingerprinting of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for ensuring the security and transparency of AI-integrated applications. While existing methods primarily rely on access to direct interactions with the application to infer model identity, they often fail in real-world scenarios involving multi-agent systems, frequent model updates, and restricted access to model internals. In this paper, we introduce a novel fingerprinting framework designed to address these challenges by integrating static and dynamic fingerprinting techniques. Our approach identifies architectural features and behavioral traits, enabling accurate and robust fingerprinting of LLMs in dynamic environments. We also highlight new threat scenarios where traditional fingerprinting methods are ineffective, bridging the gap between theoretical techniques and practical application. To validate our framework, we present an extensive evaluation setup that simulates real-world conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in identifying and monitoring LLMs in Gen-AI applications. Our results highlight the framework's adaptability to diverse and evolving deployment contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in product bundling have leveraged multimodal information through sophisticated encoders, but remain constrained by limited semantic understanding and a narrow scope of knowledge. Therefore, some attempts employ In-context Learning (ICL) to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for their extensive knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. However, these efforts are inadequate in understanding mulitmodal data and exploiting LLMs' knowledge for product bundling. To bridge the gap, we introduce Bundle-MLLM, a novel framework that fine-tunes LLMs through a hybrid item tokenization approach within a well-designed optimization strategy. Specifically, we integrate textual, media, and relational data into a unified tokenization, introducing a soft separation token to distinguish between textual and non-textual tokens. Additionally, a streamlined yet powerful multimodal fusion module is employed to embed all non-textual features into a single, informative token, significantly boosting efficiency. To tailor product bundling tasks for LLMs, we reformulate the task as a multiple-choice question with candidate items as options. We further propose a progressive optimization strategy that fine-tunes LLMs for disentangled objectives: 1) learning bundle patterns and 2) enhancing multimodal semantic understanding specific to product bundling. Extensive experiments on four datasets across two domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieving temporal event sequences from textual descriptions is crucial for applications such as analyzing e-commerce behavior, monitoring social media activities, and tracking criminal incidents. To advance this task, we introduce TESRBench, a comprehensive benchmark for temporal event sequence retrieval (TESR) from textual descriptions. TESRBench includes diverse real-world datasets with synthesized and reviewed textual descriptions, providing a strong foundation for evaluating retrieval performance and addressing challenges in this domain. Building on this benchmark, we propose TPP-Embedding, a novel model for embedding and retrieving event sequences. The model leverages the TPP-LLM framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal point processes (TPPs) to encode both event texts and times. By pooling representations and applying a contrastive loss, it unifies temporal dynamics and event semantics in a shared embedding space, aligning sequence-level embeddings of event sequences and their descriptions. TPP-Embedding demonstrates superior performance over baseline models across TESRBench datasets, establishing it as a powerful solution for the temporal event sequence retrieval task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management.   Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications.   This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of large language models (LLMs) for qualitative analysis is gaining attention in various fields, including software engineering, where qualitative methods are essential for understanding human and social factors. This study aimed to investigate how LLMs are currently used in qualitative analysis and their potential applications in software engineering research, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and practices associated with their use. A systematic mapping study was conducted, analyzing 21 relevant studies to explore reported uses of LLMs for qualitative analysis. The findings indicate that LLMs are primarily used for tasks such as coding, thematic analysis, and data categorization, offering benefits like increased efficiency and support for new researchers. However, limitations such as output variability, challenges in capturing nuanced perspectives, and ethical concerns related to privacy and transparency were also identified. The study emphasizes the need for structured strategies and guidelines to optimize LLM use in qualitative research within software engineering, enhancing their effectiveness while addressing ethical considerations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has brought new vitality into various domains, generating substantial social and economic benefits. However, this swift advancement has also introduced new vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to produce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a significant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. Our SIJ method achieves near 100\% attack success rates on five well-known open-source LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results. Our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/SQL-Injection-Jailbreak.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reranking is a critical component in recommender systems, playing an essential role in refining the output of recommendation algorithms. Traditional reranking models have focused predominantly on accuracy, but modern applications demand consideration of additional criteria such as diversity and fairness. Existing reranking approaches often fail to harmonize these diverse criteria effectively at the model level. Moreover, these models frequently encounter challenges with scalability and personalization due to their complexity and the varying significance of different reranking criteria in diverse scenarios. In response, we introduce a comprehensive reranking framework enhanced by LLM, designed to seamlessly integrate various reranking criteria while maintaining scalability and facilitating personalized recommendations. This framework employs a fully connected graph structure, allowing the LLM to simultaneously consider multiple aspects such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a coherent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. A customizable input mechanism is also integrated, enabling the tuning of the language model's focus to meet specific reranking needs. We validate our approach using three popular public datasets, where our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art reranking models in balancing multiple criteria.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code-switching (CS) refers to the switching of languages within a speech signal and results in language confusion for automatic speech recognition (ASR). To address language confusion, we introduce a novel language alignment loss into ASR training to align acoustic features to pseudo-language labels learned from the ASR decoder. This approach enables frame-level language identification without the need for frame-level language annotations. To further tackle the complex token alternatives for language modeling in bilingual scenarios, we propose to employ large language models via a generative error correction method. A linguistic hint, which is derived from LAL outputs and decoded hypotheses, is introduced to guide the prompting and enhance the LLM-based generative error correction for CS-ASR. The proposed methods are evaluated on the SEAME dataset and data from the ASRU 2019 Mandarin-English code-switching speech recognition challenge. The incorporation of the proposed language alignment loss improves the CS-ASR performance for both hybrid CTC/attention and Whisper models on both datasets, with only a negligible increase in the number of parameters. This work also highlights the efficacy of language alignment loss in balancing primary-language-dominant bilingual data during training, with an 8.6% relative improvement on the ASRU dataset compared to the baseline model. Performance evaluation using large language models reveals the advantage of the linguistic hint by achieving 14.1% and 5.5% relative improvement on test sets of the ASRU and SEAME datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.

The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) frequently make errors when handling even simple numerical problems, such as comparing two small numbers. A natural hypothesis is that these errors stem from how LLMs represent numbers, and specifically, whether their representations of numbers capture their numeric values. We tackle this question from the observation that LLM errors on numerical tasks are often distributed across the digits of the answer rather than normally around its numeric value. Through a series of probing experiments and causal interventions, we show that LLMs internally represent numbers with individual circular representations per-digit in base 10. This digit-wise representation, as opposed to a value representation, sheds light on the error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning and could serve as a basis for future studies on analyzing numerical mechanisms in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of social media has made the spread of misinformation easier. In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms other open-sourced LLMs as well as OpenAI's products.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence has resulted in the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to produce text that closely resembles human communication. These models have been seamlessly integrated into diverse applications, enabling interactive and responsive communication across multiple platforms. The potential utility of chatbots transcends these traditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can offer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In this study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based chatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is meticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a conventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment code upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing, thereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for research purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as needed; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without the necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting that our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but is not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval research or interacting with chat bot agents in general.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the ability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and respond accordingly. We identify and demonstrate that the loss of context awareness, particularly in open-source models, occurs in instruction fine-tuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the performance decline is associated with a bias toward different roles learned during conversational instruction fine-tuning. We demonstrate this correlation by visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is applied and manually steering the attention heads. The bias can be learned from training examples that align with the model's internal knowledge and rely less on the user-provided context to generate correct responses. Based on these observations, we propose a metric to identify context-dependent examples from general instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to preserve context awareness after SFT. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent downstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our method effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising general instruction-following capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment of third-party applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recognition of features in satellite imagery (forests, swimming pools, etc.) depends strongly on the spatial scale of the concept and therefore the resolution of the images. This poses two challenges: Which resolution is best suited for recognizing a given concept, and where and when should the costlier higher-resolution (HR) imagery be acquired?   We present a novel scheme to address these challenges by introducing three components: (1) A technique to distill knowledge from models trained on HR imagery to recognition models that operate on imagery of lower resolution (LR), (2) a sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement, and (3) an LLM-based approach for inferring concept "scale". With these components we present a system to efficiently perform scale-aware recognition in satellite imagery, improving accuracy over single-scale inference while following budget constraints. Our novel approach offers up to a 26.3% improvement over entirely HR baselines, using 76.3% fewer HR images.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.

We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90% across 8 different private attributes. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model. Our results show the possibility of reducing privacy leakage by more than half with limited impact on utility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly with users frequently asking questions to chatbots. In the time when information is readily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive abilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such challenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to direct answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset, WikiHint, which is based on Wikipedia and includes 5,000 hints created for 1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint generation in answer-aware and answeragnostic contexts. We assess the effectiveness of the hints with human participants who answer questions with and without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight evaluation method, HintRank, to evaluate and rank hints in both answeraware and answer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate more effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions generally improves quality of generated hints, and (c) encoder-based models perform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are remarkably efficient across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the LLMs' generalization capabilities remains elusive. In our paper, we approach this task by drawing an equivalence between autoregressive transformer-based language models and Markov chains defined on a finite state space. This allows us to study the multi-step inference mechanism of LLMs from first principles. We relate the obtained results to the pathological behavior observed with LLMs such as repetitions and incoherent replies with high temperature. Finally, we leverage the proposed formalization to derive pre-training and in-context learning generalization bounds for LLMs under realistic data and model assumptions. Experiments with the most recent Llama and Gemma herds of models show that our theory correctly captures their behavior in practice.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As minimally verbal autistic (MVA) children communicate with parents through few words and nonverbal cues, parents often struggle to encourage their children to express subtle emotions and needs and to grasp their nuanced signals. We present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA child and a parent. AACessTalk provides real-time guides to the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn, recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads, we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged parents to explore their own interaction strategies and empowered the children to have more agency in communication. We discuss the implications of designing technologies for balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to reduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical settings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying biases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their contextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent systems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this gap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent systems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves simulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned perspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to expectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the generated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents initially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented political bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias observed in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current state-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This highlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit for bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems. The code to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLMsConversationalBias-7725.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to memorize structured knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which general-purpose pre-trained LLMs retain and correctly reproduce concept identifier (ID)-label associations from publicly available ontologies. We conduct a systematic evaluation across multiple ontological resources, including the Gene Ontology, Uberon, Wikidata, and ICD-10, using LLMs such as Pythia-12B, Gemini-1.5-Flash, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our findings reveal that only a small fraction of ontological concepts is accurately memorized, with GPT-4 demonstrating the highest performance. To understand why certain concepts are memorized more effectively than others, we analyze the relationship between memorization accuracy and concept popularity on the Web. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the frequency of a concept's occurrence online and the likelihood of accurately retrieving its ID from the label. This suggests that LLMs primarily acquire such knowledge through indirect textual exposure rather than directly from structured ontological resources. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to quantify prediction invariance, demonstrating that the stability of model responses across variations in prompt language and temperature settings can serve as a proxy for estimating memorization robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) famously exhibit emergent in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks using few-shot examples provided as a prompt, without updating the model's weights. Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and generating natural language content. An increasing number of services offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs demonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text classification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexity, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are investigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to find an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance with guarantees.   In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that maximizes the overall prediction accuracy. We show that prediction accuracy is non-decreasing and non-submodular and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. By leveraging a submodular function that upper bounds prediction accuracy, we develop an algorithm called ThriftLLM and prove that it achieves an instance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. In addition, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for text classification and entity matching queries on multiple real-world datasets against various baselines in our extensive experimental evaluation, while using a relatively lower cost budget, strongly supporting the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe a counter-intuitive fact that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to LLMs' limited input context length, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphSOS (Graph Sampling and Order Selection). This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphSOS improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in answering medical questions, such as achieving passing scores on medical licensing examinations. However, medical board exams or general clinical questions do not capture the complexity of realistic clinical cases. Moreover, the lack of reference explanations means we cannot easily evaluate the reasoning of model decisions, a crucial component of supporting doctors in making complex medical decisions. To address these challenges, we construct two new datasets: JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets.\footnote{Datasets and code are available at \url{https://github.com/HanjieChen/ChallengeClinicalQA}.} JAMA Clinical Challenge consists of questions based on challenging clinical cases, while Medbullets comprises simulated clinical questions. Both datasets are structured as multiple-choice question-answering tasks, accompanied by expert-written explanations. We evaluate seven LLMs on the two datasets using various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our datasets are harder than previous benchmarks. In-depth automatic and human evaluations of model-generated explanations provide insights into the promise and deficiency of LLMs for explainable medical QA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. Our project page: https://qq456cvb.github.io/projects/donut.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implementing Boolean functions with circuits consisting of logic gates is fundamental in digital computer design. However, the implemented circuit must be exactly equivalent, which hinders generative neural approaches on this task due to their occasionally wrong predictions. In this study, we introduce a generative neural model, the "Circuit Transformer", which eliminates such wrong predictions and produces logic circuits strictly equivalent to given Boolean functions. The main idea is a carefully designed decoding mechanism that builds a circuit step-by-step by generating tokens, which has beneficial "cutoff properties" that block a candidate token once it invalidate equivalence. In such a way, the proposed model works similar to typical LLMs while logical equivalence is strictly preserved. A Markov decision process formulation is also proposed for optimizing certain objectives of circuits. Experimentally, we trained an 88-million-parameter Circuit Transformer to generate equivalent yet more compact forms of input circuits, outperforming existing neural approaches on both synthetic and real world benchmarks, without any violation of equivalence constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Content-based Recommender Systems (CRSs) play a crucial role in shaping user experiences in e-commerce, online advertising, and personalized recommendations. However, due to the vast amount of categorical features, the embedding tables used in CRS models pose a significant storage bottleneck for real-world deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices. To address this problem, various embedding pruning methods have been proposed, but most existing ones require expensive retraining steps for each target parameter budget, leading to enormous computation costs. In reality, this computation cost is a major hurdle in real-world applications with diverse storage requirements, such as federated learning and streaming settings. In this paper, we propose Shapley Value-guided Embedding Reduction (Shaver) as our response. With Shaver, we view the problem from a cooperative game perspective, and quantify each embedding parameter's contribution with Shapley values to facilitate contribution-based parameter pruning. To address the inherently high computation costs of Shapley values, we propose an efficient and unbiased method to estimate Shapley values of a CRS's embedding parameters. Moreover, in the pruning stage, we put forward a field-aware codebook to mitigate the information loss in the traditional zero-out treatment. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, Shaver has demonstrated competitive performance with lightweight recommendation models across various parameter budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) hold promise for energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing. We identify substantial informatio loss during spike transmission, linked to temporal dependencies in traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron-a key factor potentially limiting SNN performance. Existing SNN architectures also underutilize modern GPUs, constrained by single-bit spike storage and isolated weight-spike operations that restrict computational efficiency. We introduce ${SpikePack}$, a neuron model designed to reduce transmission loss while preserving essential features like membrane potential reset and leaky integration. ${SpikePack}$ achieves constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexity, enabling efficient parallel processing on GPUs and also supporting serial inference on existing SNN hardware accelerators. Compatible with standard Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, ${SpikePack}$ facilitates near-lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion across various networks. Experimental results on tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation show ${SpikePack}$ achieves significant gains in accuracy and efficiency for both directly trained and converted SNNs over state-of-the-art models. Tests on FPGA-based platforms further confirm cross-platform flexibility, delivering high performance and enhanced sparsity. By enhancing information flow and rethinking SNN-ANN integration, ${SpikePack}$ advances efficient SNN deployment across diverse hardware platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) cache facilitates efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by avoiding recomputation of past KVs. As the batch size and context length increase, the oversized KV caches become a significant memory bottleneck, highlighting the need for efficient compression. Existing KV quantization rely on fine-grained quantization or the retention of a significant portion of high bit-widths caches, both of which compromise compression ratio and often fail to maintain robustness at extremely low average bit-widths. In this work, we explore the potential of rotation technique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves accurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i) Outlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the rotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii) Pre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position embedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths outliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages the massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks. RotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit quantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning and long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\% degradation on GSM8K, outperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths. RotateKV also showcases a 3.97x reduction in peak memory usage, supports 5.75x larger batch sizes, and achieves a 2.32x speedup in decoding stage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The centralization of Large Language Models (LLMs) development has created significant barriers to AI advancement, limiting the democratization of these powerful technologies. This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs. While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information. This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers. By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms. The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers). Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.

Their potential use as artificial partners with humans in sociological experiments involving conversation is an exciting prospect. But how viable is it? Here, we rigorously test the limits of agents that debate using LLMs in a preregistered study that runs multiple debate-based opinion consensus games. Each game starts with six humans, six agents, or three humans and three agents. We found that agents can blend in and concentrate on a debate's topic better than humans, improving the productivity of all players. Yet, humans perceive agents as less convincing and confident than other humans, and several behavioral metrics of humans and agents we collected deviate measurably from each other. We observed that agents are already decent debaters, but their behavior generates a pattern distinctly different from the human-generated data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by delivering state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for the joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 1000 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating their outputs' quality regarding *preference* remains a critical challenge. Existing works usually leverage an LLM as the judge for comparing LLMs' output pairwisely, yet such model-based evaluator is *weak evaluator* due to *conflicting preference*, i.e., output A is better than B, B than C, but C than A, causing contradictory evaluation results. To address this, we introduce GED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensemble and denoise these graphs for better, non-contradictory evaluation results. In particular, our method consists of two primary stages: aggregating evaluations into a unified graph and applying a denoising process to eliminate cyclic inconsistencies, ensuring a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate GED's superiority in three applications: model ranking, response selection, and model alignment tasks. Notably, GED combines small LLM evaluators (e.g., Llama3-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) to outperform stronger ones (e.g., Qwen2-72B), showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing evaluation reliability and improving model performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantized training of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open challenge, as maintaining accuracy while performing all matrix multiplications in low precision has proven difficult. This is particularly the case when fine-tuning pre-trained models, which can have large weight and activation outlier values that make lower-precision optimization difficult. To address this, we present HALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that enables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic placement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which mitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration for low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix multiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower precision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves near-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks, while delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX 4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to fully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision, while delivering performance benefits.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scientific team dynamics are critical in determining the nature and impact of research outputs. However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions. Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods. Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification. Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features. By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have facilitated a wide range of applications with distinct service-level objectives (SLOs), from latency-sensitive online tasks like interactive chatbots to throughput-oriented offline workloads like document summarization. The existing deployment model, which dedicates machines to each workload, simplifies SLO management but often leads to poor resource utilization. This paper introduces HyGen, an interference-aware LLM serving system that enables efficient co-location of online and offline workloads while preserving latency requirements. HyGen incorporates two key innovations: (1) performance control mechanisms, including a latency predictor to estimate batch execution time and an SLO-aware profiler to quantify latency interference, and (2) SLO-aware offline scheduling policies that maximize serving throughput and prevent starvation, without compromising online serving latency. Our evaluation on production workloads shows that HyGen achieves up to 3.87x overall throughput and 5.84x offline throughput gains over online and hybrid serving baselines, respectively, while strictly satisfying latency SLOs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces TinyEmo, a family of small multi-modal language models for emotional reasoning and classification. Our approach features: (1) a synthetic emotional instruct dataset for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages, (2) a Metric Projector that delegates classification from the language model allowing for more efficient training and inference, (3) a multi-modal large language model (MM-LLM) for emotional reasoning, and (4) a semi-automated framework for bias detection. TinyEmo is able to perform emotion classification and emotional reasoning, all while using substantially fewer parameters than comparable models. This efficiency allows us to freely incorporate more diverse emotional datasets, enabling strong performance on classification tasks, with our smallest model (700M parameters) outperforming larger state-of-the-art models based on general-purpose MM-LLMs with over 7B parameters. Additionally, the Metric Projector allows for interpretability and indirect bias detection in large models without additional training, offering an approach to understand and improve AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern recommender systems often create information cocoons, restricting users' exposure to diverse content. A key challenge lies in balancing content exploration and exploitation while allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be modeled as a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical structures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical modeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to provide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To address these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework that effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-LLM mechanism that jointly aligns textual descriptions with user-item collaborative information in hyperbolic space, and (2) a hierarchical representation structure that enables user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics, effectively mitigating information cocoons. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/Martin-qyma/HERec.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve knowledge with implicit subject information from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on shallow layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers with single-hop edit prompts, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. Beyond single-hop editing prompts, IFMET further incorporates multi-hop editing prompts to locate and modify knowledge across different stages of reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving complex decision-making and control tasks. However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models represent a significant advancement in large language model (LLM) development through their efficient parameter utilization. These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aerospace manufacturing demands exceptionally high precision in technical parameters. The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and QWen, in Natural Language Processing has sparked industry interest in their application to tasks including process design, material selection, and tool information retrieval. However, LLMs are prone to generating "hallucinations" in specialized domains, producing inaccurate or false information that poses significant risks to the quality of aerospace products and flight safety. This paper introduces a set of evaluation metrics tailored for LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, aiming to assess their accuracy by analyzing their performance in answering questions grounded in professional knowledge. Firstly, key information is extracted through in-depth textual analysis of classic aerospace manufacturing textbooks and guidelines. Subsequently, utilizing LLM generation techniques, we meticulously construct multiple-choice questions with multiple correct answers of varying difficulty. Following this, different LLM models are employed to answer these questions, and their accuracy is recorded. Experimental results demonstrate that the capabilities of LLMs in aerospace professional knowledge are in urgent need of improvement. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the application of LLMs in aerospace manufacturing, addressing a critical gap in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, several works have been conducted on jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot malicious demos. In particular, Zheng et al. focus on improving the efficiency of Few-Shot Jailbreaking (FSJ) by injecting special tokens into the demos and employing demo-level random search, known as Improved Few-Shot Jailbreaking (I-FSJ). Nevertheless, we notice that this method may still require a long context to jailbreak advanced models e.g. 32 shots of demos for Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Llama-3) \cite{llama3modelcard}. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of I-FSJ and propose Self-Instruct Few-Shot Jailbreaking (Self-Instruct-FSJ) facilitated with the demo-level greedy search. This framework decomposes the FSJ attack into pattern and behavior learning to exploit the model's vulnerabilities in a more generalized and efficient way. We conduct elaborate experiments to evaluate our method on common open-source models and compare it with baseline algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/iphosi/Self-Instruct-FSJ.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As modern DNN models grow ever larger, collective communications between the accelerators (allreduce, etc.) emerge as a significant performance bottleneck. Designing efficient communication schedules is challenging, given today's heterogeneous and diverse network fabrics. We present ForestColl, a tool that generates throughput-optimal schedules for any network topology. ForestColl constructs broadcast/aggregation spanning trees as the communication schedule, achieving theoretical optimality. Its schedule generation runs in strongly polynomial time and is highly scalable. ForestColl supports any network fabrics, including both switching fabrics and direct accelerator connections. We evaluated ForestColl on multi-box AMD MI250 and NVIDIA DGX A100 platforms. ForestColl showed significant improvements over the vendors' own optimized communication libraries, RCCL and NCCL, across various settings and in LLM training. ForestColl also outperformed other state-of-the-art schedule generation techniques with both more efficient generated schedules and substantially faster schedule generation speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Testing plays a crucial role in the software development cycle, enabling the detection of bugs, vulnerabilities, and other undesirable behaviors. To perform software testing, testers need to write code snippets that execute the program under test. Recently, researchers have recognized the potential of large language models (LLMs) in software testing. However, there remains a lack of fair comparisons between different LLMs in terms of test case generation capabilities.   In this paper, we propose TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for test case generation with LLMs. We collect 210 Python programs from an online programming platform, LeetCode, and design three different tasks: overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and targeted path coverage. We further evaluate sixteen popular LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones, on TESTEVAL. We find that generating test cases to cover specific program lines/branches/paths is still challenging for current LLMs, indicating a lack of ability to comprehend program logic and execution paths. We have open-sourced our dataset and benchmark pipelines at https://github.com/LLM4SoftwareTesting/TestEval.
