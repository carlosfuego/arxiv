                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a Base Station (BS) associated with local cache, which in turn is connected to the backend server and users. The contents get continuously updated at the backend server, and the BS has a local copy of the subset of the contents. Upon receiving a request from the user, the BS can either fetch a fresh version or, serve the local copy or can wait for additional requests before serving. Fetching content from the BS incurs a fixed fetching cost, serving it locally incurs an aging cost, and for each request waiting at the BS, there will be a waiting for cost per unit time. The aging cost relies on the freshness of the content, which is measured by a metric age of version (AoV). We aim to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. We pose the problem as Restless Multi-armed Bandits Problem (RMAB) and propose a Whittle index-based policy that performs very close to the optimal policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly expanded model sizes, resulting in substantial GPU memory requirements during inference. The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.

We explore and discuss some potential further enhancement for current state of the art methods for some key underlying technologies of generative AI models from algorithmic and probabilistic optimization perspective. In particular, we present an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar initial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with similar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the likelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization method to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we propose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also present a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a probability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which block is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while maintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language models by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive quantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA) based on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization degradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Digital network twins (DNTs), by representing a physical network using a virtual model, offer significant benefits such as streamlined network development, enhanced productivity, and cost reduction for next-generation (nextG) communication infrastructure. Existing works mainly describe the deployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle of DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied, particularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation, resource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents an in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into networks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent applications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include two detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world scenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally, a forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the challenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs in nextG networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, academics and the corporate sector have paid attention to serverless computing, which enables dynamic scalability and an economic model. In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on clod start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while outperforming dense Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of performance, face significant deployment challenges during inference due to their high memory demands. Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the KV cache by nearly 50%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We formally introduce a systematic (de/re)-composition approach, based on the algebraic formalism of "Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs)". Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world data sets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including: linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, ``derive, then reduce'', we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the \texttt{MCoTInstruct} dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their massive parameter counts and associated extensive computing make LLMs' deployment the main part of carbon emission from nowadays AI applications. Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly carbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as shown in Figure 1, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for LLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on such GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model size and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For instance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for inference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains infeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization algorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource constraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8, INT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)   Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their importance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision quantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and communication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the operational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache introduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that complements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance communication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU cache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Given a Large Language Model (LLM) generation, how can we identify which training data led to this generation? In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.

To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> More than 3 kV breakdown voltage was demonstrated in monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs for the first time having potential applications in 1200V or 1700V-class novel power converters. The on resistance of the fabricated transistors was ~20 ohm.mm or ~11 mili ohm.cm^2. Breakdown voltage was optimized by utilizing two field plates in either side of the transistor and optimizing their geometry. Shorter first field plate lengths (less than 2 micron) resulted in higher breakdown voltage and the possible reason for this was discussed. The transistors had a steep subthreshold swing of 92 mV / dec. The on/off ratio was greater than 10^5 and it was limited by the tool capacity. The fabricated 3 kV transistor was benchmarked against the state-of-the-art monolithic bidirectional GaN HEMTs in the performance matrices of breakdown voltage and on resistance, that showed crucial progress.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report our experience formally modelling and verifying CXL.cache, the inter-device cache coherence protocol of the Compute Express Link standard. We have used the Isabelle proof assistant to create a formal model for CXL.cache based on the prose English specification. This led to us identifying and proposing fixes to several problems we identified as unclear, ambiguous or inaccurate, some of which could lead to incoherence if left unfixed. Nearly all our issues and proposed fixes have been confirmed and tentatively accepted by the CXL consortium for adoption, save for one which is still under discussion. To validate the faithfulness of our model we performed scenario verification of essential restrictions such as "Snoop-pushes-GO", and produced a fully mechanised proof of a coherence property of the model. The considerable size of this proof, comprising tens of thousands of lemmas, prompted us to develop new proof automation tools, which we have made available for other Isabelle users working with similarly cumbersome proofs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache-assisted ultra-dense mobile edge computing (MEC) networks are a promising solution for meeting the increasing demands of numerous Internet-of-Things mobile devices (IMDs). To address the complex interferences caused by small base stations (SBSs) deployed densely in such networks, this paper explores the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and base station (BS) clustering. Additionally, security measures are introduced to protect IMDs' tasks offloaded to BSs from potential eavesdropping and malicious attacks. As for such a network framework, a computation offloading scheme is proposed to minimize IMDs' energy consumption while considering constraints such as delay, power, computing resources, and security costs, optimizing channel selections, task execution decisions, device associations, power controls, security service assignments, and computing resource allocations. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop a further improved hierarchical adaptive search (FIHAS) algorithm, giving some insights into its parallel implementation, computation complexity, and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve lower total energy consumption and delay compared to other algorithms when strict latency and cost constraints are imposed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache compression methods have mainly relied on scalar quantization techniques to reduce the memory requirements during decoding. In this work, we apply residual vector quantization, which has been widely used for high fidelity audio compression, to compress KV cache in large language models (LLM). We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output of any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector by its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each group with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using exponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters including the input and output projections normally used in a vector quantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the performance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous channels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for compressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight finetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed technique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much simpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents WarmSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous approaches to the optimization of cold starts tend to fall into two categories: optimizing the infrastructure of serverless computing to benefit all serverless functions; or function-specific tuning for individual serverless functions. In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes entire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to initialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless container, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new function instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless functions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, WarmSwap accelerates dependency loading for serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that WarmSwap can save 88\% of optimization space when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.

Frequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of the memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a sample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach involves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the number of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is blocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history structure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for blocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of values stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive impact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is incremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled sets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic to the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having better performance to the base-line system. Our approach can also be applied to other cache hierarchies and NVM technologies to mitigate the problem of write endurance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are critical for a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as inputs become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have revolutionized data processing in numerous domains, with their ability to handle extended context reasoning receiving notable recognition. To speed up inference, maintaining a key-value (KV) cache memory is essential. Nonetheless, the growing demands for KV cache memory create significant hurdles for efficient implementation. This work introduces a novel architecture, Cross-Layer Latent Attention (CLLA), aimed at compressing the KV cache to less than 2% of its original size while maintaining comparable performance levels. CLLA integrates multiple aspects of KV cache compression, including attention head/dimension reduction, layer sharing, and quantization techniques, into a cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLLA achieves lossless performance on most tasks while utilizing minimal KV cache, marking a significant advancement in practical KV cache compression.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is natural to generalize the online $k$-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point $p$, but also a subset $S$ of servers that may serve it. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$, but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$ in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.   We parameterize the problem by specifying a family $\mathcal S \subseteq 2^{[k]}$ of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache size $k$ and family $\mathcal S$:   - If all request sets are allowed ($\mathcal S=2^{[k]}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging ($\mathcal S=\{[k]\}$).   - As a function of $|\mathcal S|$ and $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most $O(k^2|\mathcal S|)$ and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal S|})$.   - For any laminar family $\mathcal S$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are $O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\log k)$ (randomized).   - The special case of laminar $\mathcal S$ that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. The optimal deterministic ratio for weighted All-or-One Paging is $\Theta(k)$. Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.   Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the generalization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\mathcal P of pages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\mathcal P into the cache. The optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$) are at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\,H_k$ (randomized).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid recomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with ultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the KV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the used static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts. Remedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic eviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual information. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache eviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context as input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context eviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags and only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The Attention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially plugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our method is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves higher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional training-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many tokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE, where it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2x, most configurations can achieve competitive performance to and higher throughput than standard transformers, but when further reducing the size of the KV cache, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers can better maintain performance, although it also introduces additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users choose the appropriate approach according to their requirements and facilitate research on the acceleration of LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities to handle long contexts. However, increasing the number of model layers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory required to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient inference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet effective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively dropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the observation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit "lazy" behavior, contributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy layers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of these lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given input. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and reduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable, and can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and Mistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results demonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\times$ with only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing long contexts remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the quadratic computational and memory overhead of the self-attention mechanism and the substantial KV cache sizes during generation. We propose LLoCO, a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using $30\times$ fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to $7.62\times$ speed-up during inference and $11.52\times$ higher throughput during finetuning, substantially reduces the cost of long document question answering. This makes it a promising solution for efficient long context processing. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/jeffreysijuntan/lloco.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the rapidly evolving domain of high-performance computing (HPC), heterogeneous architectures such as the SX-Aurora TSUBASA (SX-AT) system architecture, which integrate diverse processor types, present both opportunities and challenges for optimizing resource utilization. This paper investigates workload interference within an SX-AT system, with a specific focus on resource contention between Vector Hosts (VHs) and Vector Engines (VEs). Through comprehensive empirical analysis, the study identifies key factors contributing to performance degradation, such as cache and memory bandwidth contention, when jobs with varying computational demands share resources. To address these issues, we develop a predictive model that leverages hardware performance counters (HCs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify and predict workload interference. Our results demonstrate that the model accurately forecasts performance degradation, offering valuable insights for future research on optimizing job scheduling and resource allocation. This approach highlights the importance of adaptive resource management strategies in maintaining system efficiency and provides a foundation for future enhancements in heterogeneous supercomputing environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have shown exceptional capabilities in a wide range of tasks, such as text generation and video generation, among others. However, due to their massive parameter count, these models often require substantial storage space, imposing significant constraints on the machines deploying LLMs. To overcome this limitation, one research direction proposes to compress the models using integer replacements for floating-point numbers, in a process known as Quantization. Some recent studies suggest quantizing the key and value cache (KV Cache) of LLMs, and designing quantization techniques that treat the key and value matrices equivalently.   This work delves deeper into the asymmetric structural roles of KV Cache, a phenomenon where the transformer's output loss is more sensitive to the quantization of key matrices. We conduct a systematic examination of the attention output error resulting from key and value quantization. The phenomenon inspires us to propose an asymmetric quantization strategy. Our approach allows for 1-bit quantization of the KV cache by implementing distinct configurations for key and value matrices. We carry out experiments across a variety of datasets, demonstrating that our proposed model allows for the quantization of up to 75% decoder layers with 1 bit, while simultaneously maintaining performance levels comparable to those of the models with floating parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Trusted hardware's freshness guarantee ensures that an adversary cannot replay an old value in response to a memory read request. They rely on maintaining a version number for each cache block and ensuring their integrity using a Merkle tree. However, these existing solutions protect only a small amount of main memory (few MBs), as the extraneous memory accesses to the Merkle tree increase prohibitively with the protected memory size. We present Toleo, which uses trusted smart memory connected through a secure CXL IDE network to safely store version numbers. Toleo eliminates the need for an unscalable Merkle tree to protect the integrity of version numbers by instead using smart memory as the root of trust. Additionally, Toleo ensures version confidentiality which enables stealth versions that reduce the version storage overhead in half.   Furthermore, in the absence of Merkle tree imposed constraints, we effectively exploit version locality at page granularity to compress version number by a factor of 240. These space optimizations make it feasible for one 168 GB Toleo smart memory device to provide freshness to a 28 TB CXL-expanded main memory pool in a rack server for a negligible performance overhead. We analyze the benefits of Toleo using several privacy-sensitive genomics, graph, generative AI, and database workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the use of web browsers continues to grow, the potential for cybercrime and web-related criminal activities also increases. Digital forensic investigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical areas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of digital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as browser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential evidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies focus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps in understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different modes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing scenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private, and portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing scenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring changes in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing history, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and identifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic methodologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is novel neuromorphic imaging device that generates asynchronous events. Despite the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range features, DVS is faced with background noise problem. Spatiotemporal filter is an effective and hardware-friendly solution for DVS denoising but previous designs have large memory overhead or degraded performance issues. In this paper, we present a lightweight and real-time spatiotemporal denoising filter with set-associative cache-like memories, which has low space complexity of \text{O(m+n)} for DVS of $m\times n$ resolution. A two-stage pipeline for memory access with read cancellation feature is proposed to reduce power consumption. Further the bitwidth redundancy for event storage is exploited to minimize the memory footprint. We implemented our design on FPGA and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous spatiotemporal filters while maintaining low resource utilization and low power consumption of about 125mW to 210mW at 100MHz clock frequency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache has become a de facto technique for the inference of large language models (LLMs), where tensors of shape (layer number, head number, sequence length, feature dimension) are introduced to cache historical information for self-attention. As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can quickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory transfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes of the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on the feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to transform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by investigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression through principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA projection where significant performance degradation is observed at low compression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the orthogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate Matryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the optimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying compression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace pre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate. We empirically witness the high data efficiency of our training procedure and find that our method can sustain over 90% performance with an average KV cache compression rate of 60% (and up to 75% in certain extreme scenarios) for popular LLMs like LLaMA2-7B-base and Mistral-7B-v0.3-base.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative decoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding additional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zoned Namespace SSDs (ZNS) are introduced recently to mitigate the block interface penalties of flash-based SSDs. It is a good opportunity for flash cache to address cache throughput and write amplification (WA) issues by fully controlling data allocation and garbage collection via zone-based interfaces. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed including zone-interface compatibility, data management of large zone size, and a better tradeoff between throughput, cache hit ratio, and WA.   In this paper, we present Z-CacheLib, a zoned storage optimized flash cache on ZNS SSDs. In Z-CacheLib, we propose: 1) a new zStorage Engine for ZNS SSDs with low mapping and operational overhead, and 2) a novel zCache Engine with cross-layer optimizations to resolve the throughput regression and WA issues of garbage collection, which consists of delayed data eviction with virtual over-provisioning (vOP), a top-down eviction policy (zLRU) optimized from LRU, and a bottom-up drop mechanism (zDrop) for low WA. Our evaluation shows that Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 2X throughput, 5% improvement hit ratio, and almost no WA compared to CacheLib with compatible regular SSDs, demonstrating benefits of using ZNS SSDs for cache. Moreover, Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 6X throughput and 92% WA reduction compared with F2FS-based scheme.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU. Code is provided in https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the next-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To accommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked Transformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design choices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with AR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a seamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for training a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache acceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the ImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the impact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the generalization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate the potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of synthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may inspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse modalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Edge Learning (FEL) has emerged as a promising approach for enabling edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Despite its advantages, practical FEL deployment faces significant challenges related to device constraints and device-server interactions, necessitating heterogeneous, user-adaptive model training with limited and uncertain communication. In this paper, we introduce FedCache 2.0, a novel personalized FEL architecture that simultaneously addresses these challenges. FedCache 2.0 incorporates the benefits of both dataset distillation and knowledge cache-driven federated learning by storing and organizing distilled data as knowledge in the server-side knowledge cache. Moreover, a device-centric cache sampling strategy is introduced to tailor transferred knowledge for individual devices within controlled communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on five datasets covering image recognition, audio understanding, and mobile sensor data mining tasks demonstrate that (1) FedCache 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of model structures, data distributions, and modalities. (2) FedCache 2.0 can train splendid personalized on-device models with at least $\times$28.6 improvement in communication efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a simple yet effective neural network-based framework for global illumination rendering. Recently, rendering techniques that learn neural radiance caches by minimizing the difference (i.e., residual) between the left and right sides of the rendering equation have been suggested. Due to their ease of implementation and the advantage of excluding path integral calculations, these techniques have been applied to various fields, such as free-viewpoint rendering, differentiable rendering, and real-time rendering. However, issues of slow training and occasionally darkened renders have been noted. We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance present in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective function. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains the same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural networks. In conclusion, this method is simply implemented by ignoring the partial derivatives of the right-hand side, and theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing long-context information. However, the quadratic complexity of attention computation with respect to sequence length poses significant computational challenges, and I/O aware algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the I/O complexity for attention mechanisms, focusing on backward passes by categorizing into small and large cache scenarios. Using the red-blue pebble game framework, we establish tight bounds on I/O complexity across all cache sizes. We confirm that the de facto standard I/O aware algorithm FlashAttention is optimal for both forward and backward passes for the large cache size scenario. For small cache sizes, we provide an algorithm that improves over existing methods and achieves the tight bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to sparse attention, a mainstream speeding-up approach, deriving fine-grained lower bounds for both forward and backward passes and both small and large caches. Our findings complete the theoretical foundation for I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, offering insights for designing efficient algorithms of LLM training and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Distributed filesystems typically employ synchronous metadata updates, facing inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative for distributed filesystems. We propose AsyncFS with asynchronous metadata updates, allowing operations to return early and defer directory updates until respective read to enable latency hiding and conflict resolution. The key challenge is efficiently maintaining the synchronous semantics of metadata updates. To address this, AsyncFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the constrained on-switch resources to holistically track directory states in the network with negligible cost. This allows AsyncFS to timely aggregate and efficiently apply delayed updates using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that AsyncFS achieves up to 13.34$\times$ and 3.85$\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, InfiniFS and CFS-KV, respectively, on skewed workloads. For real-world workloads, AsyncFS improves end-to-end throughput by 21.1$\times$, 1.1$\times$ and 30.1% over Ceph, IndexFS and CFS-KV, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The adoption of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures has been gaining momentum because they provide high performance and low energy consumption by alleviating the data movement bottleneck. Yet, the security of such architectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions provides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user applications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens opportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate without significant performance overhead.   We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and leverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory and establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently running victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results demonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our side-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate. To avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and evaluate three defenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in modeling complex language patterns but face significant computational costs during inference, especially with long inputs due to the attention mechanism's memory overhead. We observe that certain attention heads exhibit a distribution where the attention weights concentrate on tokens near the query token, termed as recency aware, which focuses on local and short-range dependencies. Leveraging this insight, we propose RecurFormer, a novel architecture that replaces these attention heads with linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically the Mamba architecture. This replacement reduces the cache size without evicting tokens, thus maintaining generation quality. RecurFormer retains the ability to model long-range dependencies through the remaining attention heads and allows for reusing pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs weights with continual training. Experiments demonstrate that RecurFormer matches the original model's performance while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Our approach provides a practical solution to the computational challenges of Transformer-based LLMs inference, making it highly attractive for tasks involving long inputs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime.

We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating complex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC) simulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not tailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access pattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation platform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and computation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic mechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature vector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service upload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and extensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration of customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive evaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world ground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical scheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights - as well as a friendly workbench - for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function between users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter playback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos, especially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing experience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and recommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily overlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking Framework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a gate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and then we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a locally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been fully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of millions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback performance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity. The code and data have been released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/CItruS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.   In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded in recent years, with 128k-token context becoming a standard and million-token context becoming a reality. Efficiently supporting long-context inference remains challenging as the memory that must be allocated in key-value (KV) cache for a generation scales with its context length, limiting the number of long-context requests that can be served concurrently under a given memory budget. KV cache compression can mitigate this issue by removing under-utilized KVs from each attention head's cache and reducing its memory footprint. Higher theoretical compression rates can be achieved when the number of removed KVs varies across attention heads, but application of such a strategy within existing inference frameworks adds fragmentation and cannot realize the theoretical compression rates in physical memory. We introduce KV-Compress, a novel compression method that evicts contiguous KV blocks within a PagedAttention framework, reducing the memory footprint of the KV cache proportionally to this theoretical compression rate. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongBench for both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct while lowering the total number of compressed KVs by 4x compared with prior methods. Evaluations on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-FP8 achieve compression rates up to 8x with negligible impact on performance, and up to 64x while retaining over 90% of full-cache performance for all but three of the suite's subsets. We benchmark an integration of our method with vLLM that increases total throughput by up to 5.18x by enabling larger decoding batches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC$^0$, making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. Our work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. We provide both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Financial intelligence generation from vast data sources has typically relied on traditional methods of knowledge-graph construction or database engineering. Recently, fine-tuned financial domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), have emerged. While these advancements are promising, limitations such as high inference costs, hallucinations, and the complexity of concurrently analyzing high-dimensional financial data, emerge. This motivates our invention FISHNET (Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning, Expert swarming, and Task planning), an agentic architecture that accomplishes highly complex analytical tasks for more than 98,000 regulatory filings that vary immensely in terms of semantics, data hierarchy, or format. FISHNET shows remarkable performance for financial insight generation (61.8% success rate over 5.0% Routing, 45.6% RAG R-Precision). We conduct rigorous ablations to empirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the optimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be leveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and data integrity that are critical for financial tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, existing methods typically optimize a scalar score or ranking reward, thereby overlooking the multi-dimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we propose to extend the preference of DPO to two dimensions: segments and aspects. We first introduce a 2D supervision dataset called HelpSteer-2D. For the segment dimension, we divide the response into sentences and assign scores to each segment. For the aspect dimension, we meticulously design several criteria covering the response quality rubrics. With the 2-dimensional signals as feedback, we develop a 2D-DPO framework, decomposing the overall objective into multi-segment and multi-aspect objectives. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-DPO performs better than methods that optimize for scalar or 1-dimensional preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate reward engineering by leveraging their broad domain knowledge across various tasks. However, they often need many iterations of trial-and-error to generate effective reward functions. This process is costly because evaluating every sampled reward function requires completing the full policy optimization process for each function. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-driven reward generation framework that is able to produce state-of-the-art policies on the challenging Bi-DexHands benchmark with 20x fewer reward function samples than the prior state-of-the-art work. Our key insight is that we reduce the problem of generating task-specific rewards to the problem of coarsely estimating task progress. Our two-step solution leverages the task domain knowledge and the code synthesis abilities of LLMs to author progress functions that estimate task progress from a given state. Then, we use this notion of progress to discretize states, and generate count-based intrinsic rewards using the low-dimensional state space. We show that the combination of LLM-generated progress functions and count-based intrinsic rewards is essential for our performance gains, while alternatives such as generic hash-based counts or using progress directly as a reward function fall short.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose UnCLe, a standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal depth estimation task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. Existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel non-stationary distributions, they "catastrophically forget" previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models for indoor and outdoor and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we introduce model inversion quality as an additional measure of forgetting. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study explores the ability of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to detect and correct hallucinations in AI-generated content. A primary agent was tasked with creating a blog about a fictional Danish artist named Flipfloppidy, which was then reviewed by another agent for factual inaccuracies. Most LLMs hallucinated the existence of this artist. Across 4,900 test runs involving various combinations of primary and reviewing agents, advanced AI models such as Llama3-70b and GPT-4 variants demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in identifying hallucinations and successfully revised outputs in 85% to 100% of cases following feedback. These findings underscore the potential of advanced AI models to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated content, providing a promising approach to improving AI workflow orchestration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding. However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating diverse and effective clarifying questions is crucial for improving query understanding and retrieval performance in open-domain conversational search (CS) systems. We propose AGENT-CQ (Automatic GENeration, and evaluaTion of Clarifying Questions), an end-to-end LLM-based framework addressing the challenges of scalability and adaptability faced by existing methods that rely on manual curation or template-based approaches. AGENT-CQ consists of two stages: a generation stage employing LLM prompting strategies to generate clarifying questions, and an evaluation stage (CrowdLLM) that simulates human crowdsourcing judgments using multiple LLM instances to assess generated questions and answers based on comprehensive quality metrics. Extensive experiments on the ClariQ dataset demonstrate CrowdLLM's effectiveness in evaluating question and answer quality. Human evaluation and CrowdLLM show that the AGENT-CQ - generation stage, consistently outperforms baselines in various aspects of question and answer quality. In retrieval-based evaluation, LLM-generated questions significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness for both BM25 and cross-encoder models compared to human-generated questions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while Llama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing fully automated, end-to-end penetration testing. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks in different domains. However, their performance in closed-book biomedical machine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth. In this work, we evaluate GPT on four closed-book biomedical MRC benchmarks. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting method. To solve some of the retrieval problems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector databases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups. Moreover, we report qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get the best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of them. Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot setting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of model compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are more amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> It is important to estimate an accurate signed distance function (SDF) from a point cloud in many computer vision applications. The latest methods learn neural SDFs using either a data-driven based or an overfitting-based strategy. However, these two kinds of methods are with either poor generalization or slow convergence, which limits their capability under challenging scenarios like highly noisy point clouds. To resolve this issue, we propose a method to promote pros of both data-driven based and overfitting-based methods for better generalization, faster inference, and higher accuracy in learning neural SDFs. We introduce a novel statistical reasoning algorithm in local regions which is able to finetune data-driven based priors without signed distance supervision, clean point cloud, or point normals. This helps our method start with a good initialization, and converge to a minimum in a much faster way. Our numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods show our superiority over these methods in surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising on widely used shape and scene benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Logic programming, as exemplified by datalog, defines the meaning of a program as its unique smallest model: the deductive closure of its inference rules. However, many problems call for an enumeration of models that vary along some set of choices while maintaining structural and logical constraints -- there is no single canonical model. The notion of stable models for logic programs with negation has successfully captured programmer intuition about the set of valid solutions for such problems, giving rise to a family of programming languages and associated solvers known as answer set programming. Unfortunately, the definition of a stable model is frustratingly indirect, especially in the presence of rules containing free variables.   We propose a new formalism, finite-choice logic programming, that uses choice, not negation, to admit multiple solutions. Finite-choice logic programming contains all the expressive power of the stable model semantics, gives meaning to a new and useful class of programs, and enjoys a least-fixed-point interpretation over a novel domain. We present an algorithm for exploring the solution space and prove it correct with respect to our semantics. Our implementation, the Dusa logic programming language, has performance that compares favorably with state-of-the-art answer set solvers and exhibits more predictable scaling with problem size.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We incorporate prior graph topology information into a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) to predict the future states of a dynamical system defined on a graph. The informed NCDE infers the future dynamics at the vertices of simulated advection data on graph edges with a known causal graph, observed only at vertices during training. We investigate different positions in the model architecture to inform the NCDE with graph information and identify an outer position between hidden state and control as theoretically and empirically favorable. Our such informed NCDE requires fewer parameters to reach a lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to previous methods that do not incorporate additional graph topology information.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Home robots performing personalized tasks must adeptly balance user preferences with environmental affordances. We focus on organization tasks within constrained spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges. First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In drug discovery, highly automated high-throughput laboratories are used to screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These experiments are expensive, so we might hope to reduce their cost by experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of an uncertainty-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that stops running the experiments when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that deploying active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in experimental cost while obtaining high system performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. Instruction, data, and code triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability issue, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, $C^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). Quantitative results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperforms nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, an LLM user study revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at an anonymized project site, with ample qualitative examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM plans out concise solution steps from the intent combined with few-shot prompting. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding solution steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought of code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.

The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Phase reduction is an important tool for studying coupled and driven oscillators. The question of how to generalize phase reduction to stochastic oscillators remains actively debated. In this work, we propose a method to derive a self-contained stochastic phase equation of the form $\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} \phi = a(\phi)\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{2D(\phi)}\,\mathop{}\!\mathrm{d} W(t)$ that is valid not only for noise-perturbed limit cycles, but also for noise-induced oscillations. We show that our reduction captures the asymptotic statistics of qualitatively different stochastic oscillators, and use it to infer their phase-response properties.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Almost all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models, except in one case involving fine-tuning using a substantial amount of human behavior data. Causes of failure are diverse, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results caution against using LLMs to study human behaviors or as human surrogates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Like spoken languages, a single sign language expression could correspond to multiple valid textual interpretations. Hence, learning a rigid one-to-one mapping for sign language translation (SLT) models might be inadequate, particularly in the case of limited data. In this work, we introduce a Diverse Sign Language Translation (DivSLT) task, aiming to generate diverse yet accurate translations for sign language videos. Firstly, we employ large language models (LLM) to generate multiple references for the widely-used CSL-Daily and PHOENIX14T SLT datasets. Here, native speakers are only invited to touch up inaccurate references, thus significantly improving the annotation efficiency. Secondly, we provide a benchmark model to spur research in this task. Specifically, we investigate multi-reference training strategies to enable our DivSLT model to achieve diverse translations. Then, to enhance translation accuracy, we employ the max-reward-driven reinforcement learning objective that maximizes the reward of the translated result. Additionally, we utilize multiple metrics to assess the accuracy, diversity, and semantic precision of the DivSLT task. Experimental results on the enriched datasets demonstrate that our DivSLT method achieves not only better translation performance but also diverse translation results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a two-stage estimation procedure for a copula-based model with semi-competing risks data, where the non-terminal event is subject to dependent censoring by the terminal event, and both events are subject to independent censoring. With a copula-based model, the marginal survival functions of individual event times are specified by semiparametric transformation models, and the dependence between the bivariate event times is specified by a parametric copula function. For the estimation procedure, in the first stage, the parameters associated with the marginal of the terminal event are estimated using only the corresponding observed outcomes, and in the second stage, the marginal parameters for the non-terminal event time and the copula parameter are estimated together via maximizing a pseudo-likelihood function based on the joint distribution of the bivariate event times. We derived the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and provided an analytic variance estimator for inference. Through simulation studies, we showed that our approach leads to consistent estimates with less computational cost and more robustness than the one-stage procedure developed in Chen (2012), where all parameters were estimated simultaneously. In addition, our approach demonstrates more desirable finite-sample performances over another existing two-stage estimation method proposed in Zhu et al. (2021). An R package PMLE4SCR is developed to implement our proposed method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but often face limited research focus due to their low prevalence. This results in prolonged diagnoses and a lack of approved therapies. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering potential to improve medical diagnosis and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning rare diseases, and struggle to handle the latest rare disease information. They also cannot effectively manage rare disease data and are not directly suitable for diagnosis and management tasks. Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of information from medical texts about rare diseases, focusing on entities and their relations. AutoRD integrates up-to-date structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Funds rate in the United States plays a significant role in both domestic and international financial markets. However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts. Given that few studies have focused on employing LLM agents to simulate large-scale real-world conferences, our work can serve as a benchmark for future developments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Point cloud frame interpolation is a challenging task that involves accurate scene flow estimation across frames and maintaining the geometry structure. Prevailing techniques often rely on pre-trained motion estimators or intensive testing-time optimization, resulting in compromised interpolation accuracy or prolonged inference. This work presents FastPCI that introduces Pyramid Convolution-Transformer architecture for point cloud frame interpolation. Our hybrid Convolution-Transformer improves the local and long-range feature learning, while the pyramid network offers multilevel features and reduces the computation. In addition, FastPCI proposes a unique Dual-Direction Motion-Structure block for more accurate scene flow estimation. Our design is motivated by two facts: (1) accurate scene flow preserves 3D structure, and (2) point cloud at the previous timestep should be reconstructable using reverse motion from future timestep. Extensive experiments show that FastPCI significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PointINet and NeuralPCI with notable gains (e.g. 26.6% and 18.3% reduction in Chamfer Distance in KITTI), while being more than 10x and 600x faster, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Period-prevalent cohorts are often used for their cost-saving potential in epidemiological studies of survival outcomes. Under this design, prevalent patients allow for evaluations of long-term survival outcomes without the need for long follow-up, whereas incident patients allow for evaluations of short-term survival outcomes without the issue of left-truncation. In most period-prevalent survival analyses from the existing literature, patients have been recruited to achieve an overall sample size, with little attention given to the relative frequencies of prevalent and incident patients and their statistical implications. Furthermore, there are no existing methods available to rigorously quantify the impact of these relative frequencies on estimation and inference and incorporate this information into study design strategies. To address these gaps, we develop an approach to identify the optimal mix of prevalent and incident patients that maximizes precision over the entire estimated survival curve, subject to a flexible weighting scheme. In addition, we prove that inference based on the weighted log-rank test or Cox proportional hazards model is most powerful with an entirely prevalent or incident cohort, and we derive theoretical formulas to determine the optimal choice. Simulations confirm the validity of the proposed optimization criteria and show that substantial efficiency gains can be achieved by recruiting the optimal mix of prevalent and incident patients. The proposed methods are applied to assess waitlist outcomes among kidney transplant candidates.

The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.   To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have demonstrated success in optimizing resource allocation for large beneficiary populations in public health settings. Unfortunately, RMAB models lack flexibility to adapt to evolving public health policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept automated planners across domains of robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI, yet they encounter the challenge of efficient updates. Model editing enables the manipulation of specific knowledge memories and the behavior of language generation without retraining. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) allows users to share knowledge instead of raw data to train a model with high accuracy. Unfortunately, during the training, users lose control over the knowledge shared, which causes serious data privacy issues. We hold that users are only willing and need to share the essential knowledge to the training task to obtain the FL model with high accuracy. However, existing efforts cannot help users minimize the shared knowledge according to the user intention in the FL training procedure. This work proposes FLiP, which aims to bring the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to FL training. The key design of FLiP is applying elaborate information reduction on the training data through a local-global dataset distillation design. We measure the privacy performance through attribute inference and membership inference attacks. Extensive experiments show that FLiP strikes a good balance between model accuracy and privacy protection.

We formalize identification within the potential outcomes framework and then provide estimation based on machine learning algorithms. To illustrate the practical relevance of our method, we present simulation evidence, a replication study, and an empirical application on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on educational inequality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians plays a pivotal role for embodied intelligent applications. The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at: github.com/TIB-K330/pmm-net.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing fairness benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on simple tasks, such as multiple-choice questions, overlooking biases that may arise in more complex scenarios like long-text generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates biases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our evaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two key patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic groups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses while neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a finetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. FT-REGARD reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Satellites are increasingly adopting on-board AI to optimize operations and increase autonomy through in-orbit inference. The use of Deep Learning (DL) models for segmentation in hyperspectral imagery offers advantages for remote sensing applications. In this work, we train and test 20 models for multi-class segmentation in hyperspectral imagery, selected for their potential in future space deployment. These models include 1D and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the latest vision transformers (ViTs). We propose a lightweight 1D-CNN model, 1D-Justo-LiuNet, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in the hypespectral domain. 1D-Justo-LiuNet exceeds the performance of 2D-CNN UNets and outperforms Apple's lightweight vision transformers designed for mobile inference. 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy (0.93) with the smallest model size (4,563 parameters) among all tested models, while maintaining fast inference. Unlike 2D-CNNs and ViTs, which encode both spectral and spatial information, 1D-Justo-LiuNet focuses solely on the rich spectral features in hyperspectral data, benefitting from the high-dimensional feature space. Our findings are validated across various satellite datasets, with the HYPSO-1 mission serving as the primary case study for sea, land, and cloud segmentation. We further confirm our conclusions through generalization tests on other hyperspectral missions, such as NASA's EO-1. Based on its superior performance and compact size, we conclude that 1D-Justo-LiuNet is highly suitable for in-orbit deployment, providing an effective solution for optimizing and automating satellite operations at edge.

Traditional fake news detection methods relying on linguistic cues also becomes less effective. Moreover, current detectors primarily focus on binary classification and English texts, often overlooking the distinction between machine-generated true vs. fake news and the detection in low-resource languages. To this end, we updated detection schema to include machine-generated news with focus on the Urdu language. We further propose a hierarchical detection strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness. Experiments show its effectiveness across four datasets in various settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conformal prediction (CP) is a robust framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, but it requires exchangeable data to ensure valid prediction sets at a user-specified significance level. When this assumption is violated, as in time-series or other structured data, the validity guarantees of CP no longer hold. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) was introduced to address this limitation by adjusting the significance level dynamically, ensuring finite-sample coverage guarantees even for non-exchangeable data. In this paper, we show that ACI does not require the use of conformal predictors; instead, it can be implemented with the more general confidence predictors, which are computationally simpler and still maintain the crucial property of nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that confidence predictors can perform comparably to, or even better than, conformal predictors, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. These findings suggest that confidence predictors represent a viable and efficient alternative to conformal predictors in non-exchangeable data settings, although further studies are needed to identify when one method is superior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used to model dependency in spatial statistics and machine learning, yet the exact computation suffers an intractable time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Vecchia approximation allows scalable Bayesian inference of GPs in $O(n)$ time by introducing sparsity in the spatial dependency structure that is characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Despite the popularity in practice, it is still unclear how to choose the DAG structure and there are still no theoretical guarantees in nonparametric settings. In this paper, we systematically study the Vecchia GPs as standalone stochastic processes and uncover important probabilistic properties and statistical results in methodology and theory. For probabilistic properties, we prove that the conditional distributions of the Mat\'{e}rn GPs, as well as the Vecchia approximations of the Mat\'{e}rn GPs, can be characterized by polynomials. This allows us to prove a series of results regarding the small ball probabilities and RKHSs of Vecchia GPs. For statistical methodology, we provide a principled guideline to choose parent sets as norming sets with fixed cardinality and provide detailed algorithms following such guidelines. For statistical theory, we prove posterior contraction rates for applying Vecchia GPs to regression problems, where minimax optimality is achieved by optimally tuned GPs via either oracle rescaling or hierarchical Bayesian methods. Our theory and methodology are demonstrated with numerical studies, where we also provide efficient implementation of our methods in C++ with R interfaces.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to high inference costs and memory requirements. To address these issues, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a popular method for model compression, with student-generated outputs (SGOs) being particularly notable for reducing the mismatch between training and inference. However, SGOs often produce noisy and biased sequences, which can lead to misguidance from the teacher model, especially in long sequences. To mitigate these challenges, we propose SWITCH (Studying WIth TeaCHer for Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach that strategically incorporates the teacher model during the student's sequence generation. SWITCH identifies discrepancies between the token probabilities of the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher to intervene selectively, particularly in long sequences that are more prone to teacher misguidance. Extensive experimental results across three model families and five instruction-following datasets show that SWITCH surpasses traditional KD methods, particularly excelling in the generation of long sequential data.

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph machine learning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term graph linearization, so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality, degeneracy, and node relabeling schemes. We then investigated their effect on LLM performance in graph reasoning tasks. Experimental results on synthetic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to random linearization baselines. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multi-modal processing using a unified transformer model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling distributions that depend on external control parameters is a common scenario in diverse applications like molecular simulations, where system properties like temperature affect molecular configurations. Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on backward training, which is prone to unstable training. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d. samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved a degree of success in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, yet they remain prone to a significant challenge known as hallucination: producing information that is not substantiated by the input or external knowledge. Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations have focused on techniques such as fine-tuning models on high-quality datasets, incorporating fact-checking mechanisms, and developing adversarial training methods. While these approaches have shown some promise, they often address the issue at the level of individual model outputs, leaving unexplored the effects of inter-model interactions on hallucination. This study investigates the phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs through a novel experimental framework where multiple instances of GPT-4o-Mini models engage in a debate-like interaction prompted with questions from the TruthfulQA dataset. One model is deliberately instructed to generate plausible but false answers while the other models are asked to respond truthfully. The experiment is designed to assess whether the introduction of misinformation by one model can challenge the truthful majority to better justify their reasoning, improving performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark. The findings suggest that inter-model interactions can offer valuable insights into improving the accuracy and robustness of LLM outputs, complementing existing mitigation strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stroke-based Rendering (SBR) aims to decompose an input image into a sequence of parameterized strokes, which can be rendered into a painting that resembles the input image. Recently, Neural Painting methods that utilize deep learning and reinforcement learning models to predict the stroke sequences have been developed, but suffer from longer inference time or unstable training. To address these issues, we propose AttentionPainter, an efficient and adaptive model for single-step neural painting. First, we propose a novel scalable stroke predictor, which predicts a large number of stroke parameters within a single forward process, instead of the iterative prediction of previous Reinforcement Learning or auto-regressive methods, which makes AttentionPainter faster than previous neural painting methods. To further increase the training efficiency, we propose a Fast Stroke Stacking algorithm, which brings 13 times acceleration for training. Moreover, we propose Stroke-density Loss, which encourages the model to use small strokes for detailed information, to help improve the reconstruction quality. Finally, we propose a new stroke diffusion model for both conditional and unconditional stroke-based generation, which denoises in the stroke parameter space and facilitates stroke-based inpainting and editing applications helpful for human artists design. Extensive experiments show that AttentionPainter outperforms the state-of-the-art neural painting methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to memorizing training data, raising concerns due to the potential extraction of sensitive information. Current methods to measure memorization rates of LLMs, primarily discoverable extraction (Carlini et al., 2022), rely on single-sequence greedy sampling, potentially underestimating the true extent of memorization. This paper introduces a probabilistic relaxation of discoverable extraction that quantifies the probability of extracting a target sequence within a set of generated samples, considering various sampling schemes and multiple attempts. This approach addresses the limitations of reporting memorization rates through discoverable extraction by accounting for the probabilistic nature of LLMs and user interaction patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that this probabilistic measure can reveal cases of higher memorization rates compared to rates found through discoverable extraction. We further investigate the impact of different sampling schemes on extractability, providing a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of LLM memorization and its associated risks. Our contributions include a new probabilistic memorization definition, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and a thorough evaluation across different models, sizes, sampling schemes, and training data repetitions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the supervised classification setting, during inference, deep networks typically make multiple predictions. For a pair of such predictions (that are in the top-k predictions), two distinct possibilities might occur. On the one hand, each of the two predictions might be primarily driven by two distinct sets of entities in the input. On the other hand, it is possible that there is a single entity or set of entities that is driving the prediction for both the classes in question. This latter case, in effect, corresponds to the network making two separate guesses about the identity of a single entity type. Clearly, both the guesses cannot be true, i.e. both the labels cannot be present in the input. Current techniques in interpretability research do not readily disambiguate these two cases, since they typically consider input attributions for one class label at a time. Here, we present a framework and method to do so, leveraging modern segmentation and input attribution techniques. Notably, our framework also provides a simple counterfactual "proof" of each case, which can be verified for the input on the model (i.e. without running the method again). We demonstrate that the method performs well for a number of samples from the ImageNet validation set and on multiple models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To further improve Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), a profound understanding of complex battery processes is crucial. Physical models offer understanding but are difficult to validate and parameterize. Therefore, automated machine-learning methods (ML) are necessary to evaluate models with experimental data. Bayesian methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization for likelihood-free inference (EP-BOLFI), stand out as they capture uncertainties in models and data while granting meaningful parameterization. An important topic is prolonging battery lifetime, which is limited by degradation, such as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. As a case study, we apply EP-BOLFI to parametrize SEI growth models with synthetic and real degradation data. EP-BOLFI allows for incorporating human expertise in the form of suitable feature selection, which improves the parametrization. We show that even under impeded conditions, we achieve correct parameterization with reasonable uncertainty quantification, needing less computational effort than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the physically reliable summary statistics show if parameters are strongly correlated and not unambiguously identifiable. Further, we investigate Bayesian alternately subsampled quadrature (BASQ), which calculates model probabilities, to confirm electron diffusion as the best theoretical model to describe SEI growth during battery storage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Domain generalization (DG) methods aim to maintain good performance in an unseen target domain by using training data from multiple source domains. While success on certain occasions are observed, enhancing the baseline across most scenarios remains challenging. This work introduces a simple yet effective framework, dubbed learning from multiple experts (LFME), that aims to make the target model an expert in all source domains to improve DG. Specifically, besides learning the target model used in inference, LFME will also train multiple experts specialized in different domains, whose output probabilities provide professional guidance by simply regularizing the logit of the target model. Delving deep into the framework, we reveal that the introduced logit regularization term implicitly provides effects of enabling the target model to harness more information, and mining hard samples from the experts during training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks from different DG tasks demonstrate that LFME is consistently beneficial to the baseline and can achieve comparable performance to existing arts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods often struggle with inefficiency and the handling of high-dimensional data. To address these research gap, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. On this basis, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing the algebraic characterization of acyclicity with new capabilities: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML generates causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring the creation of DAGs while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing the dynamic causal structure of high-dimensional data and enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods, and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery. Our code will be available soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous agents operating on the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of various applications hold immense practical value. Unlike the large language model (LLM)-based methods which rely on structured texts and customized backends, the approaches using large vision-language models (LVLMs) are more intuitive and adaptable as they can visually perceive and directly interact with screens, making them indispensable in general scenarios without text metadata and tailored backends. Given the lack of high-quality training data for GUI-related tasks in existing work, this paper aims to enhance the GUI understanding and interacting capabilities of LVLMs through a data-driven approach. We propose EDGE, a general data synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale, multi-granularity training data from webpages across the Web. Evaluation results on various GUI and agent benchmarks demonstrate that the model trained with the dataset generated through EDGE exhibits superior webpage understanding capabilities, which can then be easily transferred to previously unseen desktop and mobile environments. Our approach significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotations, empowering researchers to harness the vast public resources available on the Web to advance their work. Our source code, the dataset and the model are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDGE-1CDB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel approach for accelerating AI performance by leveraging Anderson extrapolation, a vector-to-vector mapping technique based on a window of historical iterations. By identifying the crossover point where a mixing penalty is incurred, the method focuses on reducing iterations to convergence, with fewer more compute-intensive but generally cacheable iterations, balancing speed and memory usage with accuracy and algorithmic stability, respectively. We demonstrate significant improvements, in both training and inference, motivated by scalability and efficiency extensions to the realm of high-performance computing (HPC).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.

However, there is limited research on the training behavior and computational requirements of SLMs. In this study, we explore the computational bottlenecks of training SLMs (up to 2B parameters) by examining the effects of various hyperparameters and configurations, including GPU type, batch size, model size, communication protocol, attention type, and the number of GPUs. We assess these factors on popular cloud services using metrics such as loss per dollar and tokens per second. Our findings aim to support the broader adoption and optimization of language model training for low-resource AI research institutes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can rapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a performance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant ones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128\% improvement in SSIM and an 81\% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation. Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, \textbf{Co}llaborative \textbf{Lo}RA (CoRA), with a collaborative query generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings and inject them into a set number of learnable queries. We then convert collaborative queries into collaborative weights with low-rank properties and merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We report an updated analysis of the radius, mass, and heated surface regions of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data from 2018 September 21 to 2022 April 21, a substantial increase in data set size compared to previous analyses. Using a tight mass prior from radio timing measurements and jointly modeling the new NICER data with XMM-Newton data, the inferred equatorial radius and gravitational mass are $12.49_{-0.88}^{+1.28}$ km and $2.073_{-0.069}^{+0.069}$ $M_\odot$ respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles, with an estimated systematic error $\lesssim 0.1$ km. This result was obtained using the best computationally feasible sampler settings providing a strong radius lower limit but a slightly more uncertain radius upper limit. The inferred radius interval is also close to the $R=12.76_{-1.02}^{+1.49}$ km obtained by Dittmann et al., when they require the radius to be less than $16$ km as we do. The results continue to disfavor very soft equations of state for dense matter, with $R<11.15$ km for this high-mass pulsar excluded at the $95\,\%$ probability. The results do not depend significantly on the assumed cross-calibration uncertainty between NICER and XMM-Newton. Using simulated data that resemble the actual observations, we also show that our pipeline is capable of recovering parameters for the inferred models reported in this paper.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The notable success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked an upsurge in building language agents to complete various complex tasks. We present AMOR, an agent framework based on open-source LLMs, which reasons with external knowledge bases and adapts to specific domains through human supervision to the reasoning process. AMOR builds reasoning logic over a finite state machine (FSM) that solves problems through autonomous executions and transitions over disentangled modules. This allows humans to provide direct feedback to the individual modules, and thus naturally forms process supervision. Based on this reasoning and feedback framework, we develop AMOR through two-stage fine-tuning: warm-up and adaptation. The former fine-tunes the LLM with examples automatically constructed from various public datasets, enabling AMOR to generalize across different knowledge environments, while the latter tailors AMOR to specific domains using process feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the advantage of AMOR to strong baselines, thanks to its FSM-based reasoning and process feedback mechanism.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High-definition (HD) map provides abundant and precise static environmental information of the driving scene, serving as a fundamental and indispensable component for planning in autonomous driving system. In this paper, we present \textbf{Map} \textbf{TR}ansformer, an end-to-end framework for online vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach, \ie, modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite matching for map element learning. To speed up convergence, we further introduce auxiliary one-to-many matching and dense supervision. The proposed method well copes with various map elements with arbitrary shapes. It runs at real-time inference speed and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Abundant qualitative results show stable and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-To-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated the ability to generate compelling text and visual stories. However, their outputs are predominantly aligned with the sensibilities of the Global North, often resulting in an outsider's gaze on other cultures. As a result, non-Western communities have to put extra effort into generating culturally specific stories. To address this challenge, we developed a visual storytelling pipeline called KAHANI that generates culturally grounded visual stories for non-Western cultures. Our pipeline leverages off-the-shelf models GPT-4 Turbo and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). By using Chain of Thought (CoT) and T2I prompting techniques, we capture the cultural context from user's prompt and generate vivid descriptions of the characters and scene compositions. To evaluate the effectiveness of KAHANI, we conducted a comparative user study with ChatGPT-4 (with DALL-E3) in which participants from different regions of India compared the cultural relevance of stories generated by the two tools. Results from the qualitative and quantitative analysis performed on the user study showed that KAHANI was able to capture and incorporate more Culturally Specific Items (CSIs) compared to ChatGPT-4. In terms of both its cultural competence and visual story generation quality, our pipeline outperformed ChatGPT-4 in 27 out of the 36 comparisons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier's ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are being used in data science code generation tasks, but they often struggle with complex sequential tasks, leading to logical errors. Their application to geospatial data processing is particularly challenging due to difficulties in incorporating complex data structures and spatial constraints, effectively utilizing diverse function calls, and the tendency to hallucinate less-used geospatial libraries. To tackle these problems, we introduce GeoAgent, a new interactive framework designed to help LLMs handle geospatial data processing more effectively. GeoAgent pioneers the integration of a code interpreter, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, offering a novel approach to geospatial data processing. In addition, we contribute a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the LLM-based approach in geospatial tasks. This benchmark leverages a variety of Python libraries and includes both single-turn and multi-turn tasks such as data acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. By offering a comprehensive evaluation among diverse geospatial contexts, this benchmark sets a new standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks. Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the proposed GeoAgent has demonstrated superior performance, yielding notable improvements in function calls and task completion. In addition, these results offer valuable insights for the future development of LLM agents in automatic geospatial data analysis task programming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transfer learning has gained significant attention in recent deep learning research due to its ability to accelerate convergence and enhance performance on new tasks. However, its success is often contingent on the similarity between source and target data, and training on numerous datasets can be costly, leading to blind selection of pretrained models with limited insight into their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce D2NWG, a diffusion-based neural network weights generation technique that efficiently produces high-performing weights for transfer learning, conditioned on the target dataset. Our method extends generative hyper-representation learning to recast the latent diffusion paradigm for neural network weights generation, learning the weight distributions of models pretrained on various datasets. This allows for automatic generation of weights that generalize well across both seen and unseen tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art meta-learning methods and pretrained models. Moreover, our approach is scalable to large architectures such as large language models (LLMs), overcoming the limitations of current parameter generation techniques that rely on task-specific model collections or access to original training data. By modeling the parameter distribution of LLMs, D2NWG enables task-specific parameter generation without requiring additional fine-tuning or large collections of model variants. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently enhances the performance of diverse base models, regardless of their size or complexity, positioning it as a robust solution for scalable transfer learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful computational models trained on extensive corpora of human-readable text, enabling them to perform general-purpose language understanding and generation. LLMs have garnered significant attention in both industry and academia due to their exceptional performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these successes, LLMs often produce inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prompt engineering, the process of designing and formulating instructions for LLMs to perform specific tasks, has emerged as a key approach to mitigating hallucinations. This paper provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of different prompting strategies and frameworks aimed at reducing hallucinations in LLMs. Various prompting techniques are applied to a broad set of benchmark datasets to assess the accuracy and hallucination rate of each method. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of tool-calling agents (LLMs augmented with external tools to enhance their capabilities beyond language generation) on hallucination rates in the same benchmarks. The findings demonstrate that the optimal prompting technique depends on the type of problem, and that simpler techniques often outperform more complex methods in reducing hallucinations. Furthermore, it is shown that LLM agents can exhibit significantly higher hallucination rates due to the added complexity of external tool usage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Volumetric segmentation is important in medical imaging, but current methods face challenges like requiring lots of manual annotations and being tailored to specific tasks, which limits their versatility. General segmentation models used for natural images don't perform well with the unique features of medical images. There's a strong need for an adaptable approach that can effectively handle different 3D medical structures and imaging modalities. In this study, we present PAM (Propagating Anything Model), a segmentation approach that uses a 2D prompt, like a bounding box or sketch, to create a complete 3D segmentation of medical image volumes. PAM works by modeling relationships between slices, maintaining information flow across the 3D structure. It combines a CNN-based UNet for processing within slices and a Transformer-based attention module for propagating information between slices, leading to better generalizability across various imaging modalities. PAM significantly outperformed existing models like MedSAM and SegVol, with an average improvement of over 18.1% in dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across 44 medical datasets and various object types. It also showed stable performance despite prompt deviations and different propagation setups, and faster inference speeds compared to other models. PAM's one-view prompt design made it more efficient, reducing interaction time by about 63.6% compared to two-view prompts. Thanks to its focus on structural relationships, PAM handled unseen and complex objects well, showing a unique ability to generalize to new situations. PAM represents an advancement in medical image segmentation, effectively reducing the need for extensive manual work and specialized training. Its adaptability makes it a promising tool for more automated and reliable analysis in clinical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multi-task performance. Therefore, researchers have been seeking to integrate LLMs in the broad sense of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) field. Different from the traditional method of cascading LLMs to process text generated by Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), new efforts have focused on designing architectures centered around Audio Feature Extraction - Multimodal Information Fusion - LLM Inference(Speech LLMs). This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while simultaneously facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures and training strategies. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses Speech LLMs' advancements in Rich Audio Transcription and its potential for Cross-task Integration within the SLU field. Additionally, it indicates key challenges uncovered through experimentation, such as the Dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further delves into the training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposing potential solutions based on these findings, and offering valuable insights and references for future research in this domain, as well as LLM applications in multimodal contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The significance of distributed learning and inference algorithms in Internet of Things (IoT) network is growing since they flexibly distribute computation load between IoT devices and the infrastructure, enhance data privacy, and minimize latency. However, a notable challenge stems from the influence of communication channel conditions on their performance. In this work, we introduce COMSPLIT: a novel communication-aware design for split learning (SL) and inference paradigm tailored to processing time series data in IoT networks. COMSPLIT provides a versatile framework for deploying adaptable SL in IoT networks affected by diverse channel conditions. In conjunction with the integration of an early-exit strategy, and addressing IoT scenarios containing devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities, COMSPLIT represents a comprehensive design solution for communication-aware SL in IoT networks. Numerical results show superior performance of COMSPLIT compared to vanilla SL approaches (that assume ideal communication channel), demonstrating its ability to offer both design simplicity and adaptability to different channel conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance across various language understanding tasks. While emerging benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs in various domains such as mathematics and computer science, they merely measure the accuracy in terms of the final prediction on multi-choice questions. However, it remains insufficient to verify the essential understanding of LLMs given a chosen choice. To fill this gap, we present CLR-Bench to comprehensively evaluate the LLMs in complex college-level reasoning. Specifically, (i) we prioritize 16 challenging college disciplines in computer science and artificial intelligence. The dataset contains 5 types of questions, while each question is associated with detailed explanations from experts. (ii) To quantify a fair evaluation of LLMs' reasoning ability, we formalize the criteria with two novel metrics. Q$\rightarrow$A is utilized to measure the performance of direct answer prediction, and Q$\rightarrow$AR effectively considers the joint ability to answer the question and provide rationale simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted with 40 LLMs over 1,018 discipline-specific questions. The results demonstrate the key insights that LLMs, even the best closed-source LLM, i.e., GPT-4 turbo, tend to `guess' the college-level answers. It shows a dramatic decrease in accuracy from 63.31% Q$\rightarrow$A to 39.00% Q$\rightarrow$AR, indicating an unsatisfactory reasoning ability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Differential privacy (DP) provides robust privacy guarantees for statistical inference, but this can lead to unreliable results and biases in downstream applications. While several noise-aware approaches have been proposed which integrate DP perturbation into the inference, they are limited to specific types of simple probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a novel method for noise-aware approximate Bayesian inference based on stochastic gradient variational inference which can also be applied to high-dimensional and non-conjugate models. We also propose a more accurate evaluation method for noise-aware posteriors. Empirically, our inference method has similar performance to existing methods in the domain where they are applicable. Outside this domain, we obtain accurate coverages on high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression and well-calibrated predictive probabilities on Bayesian logistic regression with the UCI Adult dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a more computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, DPO and its variants remain sensitive to hyper-parameters and prone to instability, particularly on mathematical datasets. We argue that these issues arise from the unidirectional likelihood-derivative negative feedback inherent in the log-likelihood loss function. To address this, we propose a novel LLM alignment loss that establishes a stable Bidirectional Negative Feedback (BNF) during optimization. Our proposed BNF loss eliminates the need for pairwise contrastive losses and does not require any extra tunable hyper-parameters or pairwise preference data, streamlining the alignment pipeline to be as simple as supervised fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments across two challenging QA benchmarks and four reasoning benchmarks. The experimental results show that BNF achieves comparable performance to the best methods on QA benchmarks, while its performance decrease on the four reasoning benchmarks is significantly lower compared to the best methods, thus striking a better balance between value alignment and reasoning ability. In addition, we further validate the performance of BNF on non-pairwise datasets, and conduct in-depth analysis of log-likelihood and logit shifts across different preference optimization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In scenarios with limited training data or where explainability is crucial, conventional neural network-based machine learning models often face challenges. In contrast, Bayesian inference-based algorithms excel in providing interpretable predictions and reliable uncertainty estimation in these scenarios. While many state-of-the-art in-memory computing (IMC) architectures leverage emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies to offer unparalleled computing capacity and energy efficiency for neural network workloads, their application in Bayesian inference is limited. This is because the core operations in Bayesian inference differ significantly from the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations common in neural networks, rendering them generally unsuitable for direct implementation in most existing IMC designs. In this paper, we propose FeBiM, an efficient and compact Bayesian inference engine powered by multi-bit ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based IMC. FeBiM effectively encodes the trained probabilities of a Bayesian inference model within a compact FeFET-based crossbar. It maps quantized logarithmic probabilities to discrete FeFET states. As a result, the accumulated outputs of the crossbar naturally represent the posterior probabilities, i.e., the Bayesian inference model's output given a set of observations. This approach enables efficient in-memory Bayesian inference without the need for additional calculation circuitry. As the first FeFET-based in-memory Bayesian inference engine, FeBiM achieves an impressive storage density of 26.32 Mb/mm$^{2}$ and a computing efficiency of 581.40 TOPS/W in a representative Bayesian classification task. These results demonstrate 10.7$\times$/43.4$\times$ improvement in compactness/efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art hardware implementation of Bayesian inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating text and numbers effectively is a crucial step towards enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities in assisting in scientific tasks. While most current approaches rely on discrete tokenization of numbers, for instance, conversion to scientific notation or base 10-decomposition, a recent approach proposed a continuous numerical encoding as an inductive bias. In this paper, we build upon this approach by introducing more expressive numerical embeddings. Our method addresses key shortcomings, including the elimination of numerical artefacts and the ability to handle a wide range of magnitudes without clipping.   Our work presents two key contributions. First, we employ an MLP to assign distinct directions in the embedding space to different numbers. Our second contribution is the introduction of a routing layer that differentiates between numerical and text embeddings. We hypothesise that this combined approach enables the model to distinguish between text and number distributions while maintaining its capacity for arithmetic operations.   Using only a 45 M parameter encoder-decoder architecture our method achieves a $R^2$=0.9988 over a wide range of magnitude ($10^{-3},10^{8}$). In addition, we empirically observe a reduction of the numerical artefacts and biases observed compared to the baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged to empower autonomous agents to simulate human beings in various fields of behavioral research. However, evaluating their capacity to navigate complex social interactions remains a challenge. Previous studies face limitations due to insufficient scenario diversity, complexity, and a single-perspective focus. To this end, we introduce AgentSense: Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Language Agents through Interactive Scenarios. Drawing on Dramaturgical Theory, AgentSense employs a bottom-up approach to create 1,225 diverse social scenarios constructed from extensive scripts. We evaluate LLM-driven agents through multi-turn interactions, emphasizing both goal completion and implicit reasoning. We analyze goals using ERG theory and conduct comprehensive experiments. Our findings highlight that LLMs struggle with goals in complex social scenarios, especially high-level growth needs, and even GPT-4o requires improvement in private information reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of human-centric personalized image generation, the adapter-based method obtains the ability to customize and generate portraits by text-to-image training on facial data. This allows for identity-preserved personalization without additional fine-tuning in inference. Although there are improvements in efficiency and fidelity, there is often a significant performance decrease in test following ability, controllability, and diversity of generated faces compared to the base model. In this paper, we analyze that the performance degradation is attributed to the failure to decouple identity features from other attributes during extraction, as well as the failure to decouple the portrait generation training from the overall generation task. To address these issues, we propose the Face Adapter with deCoupled Training (FACT) framework, focusing on both model architecture and training strategy. To decouple identity features from others, we leverage a transformer-based face-export encoder and harness fine-grained identity features. To decouple the portrait generation training, we propose Face Adapting Increment Regularization~(FAIR), which effectively constrains the effect of face adapters on the facial region, preserving the generative ability of the base model. Additionally, we incorporate a face condition drop and shuffle mechanism, combined with curriculum learning, to enhance facial controllability and diversity. As a result, FACT solely learns identity preservation from training data, thereby minimizing the impact on the original text-to-image capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments show that FACT has both controllability and fidelity in both text-to-image generation and inpainting solutions for portrait generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in multimodal learning, particularly in video understanding and generation, require high-quality video-text datasets for improved model performance. Vript addresses this issue with a meticulously annotated corpus of 12K high-resolution videos, offering detailed, dense, and script-like captions for over 420K clips. Each clip has a caption of ~145 words, which is over 10x longer than most video-text datasets. Unlike captions only documenting static content in previous datasets, we enhance video captioning to video scripting by documenting not just the content, but also the camera operations, which include the shot types (medium shot, close-up, etc) and camera movements (panning, tilting, etc). By utilizing the Vript, we explore three training paradigms of aligning more text with the video modality rather than clip-caption pairs. This results in Vriptor, a top-performing video captioning model among open-source models, comparable to GPT-4V in performance. Vriptor is also a powerful model capable of end-to-end generation of dense and detailed captions for long videos. Moreover, we introduce Vript-Hard, a benchmark consisting of three video understanding tasks that are more challenging than existing benchmarks: Vript-HAL is the first benchmark evaluating action and object hallucinations in video LLMs, Vript-RR combines reasoning with retrieval resolving question ambiguity in long-video QAs, and Vript-ERO is a new task to evaluate the temporal understanding of events in long videos rather than actions in short videos in previous works. All code, models, and datasets are available in https://github.com/mutonix/Vript. PS: We have included more video-text datasets (Vript_CN & Vript_Multilingual) in the Vript series.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge editing is a rising technique for efficiently updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs) with minimal alteration of parameters. However, recent studies have identified side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. Despite these findings, evaluating the pitfalls of knowledge editing often relies on inconsistent metrics and benchmarks, lacking a uniform standard. In response, this survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified perspective on the challenges of knowledge editing in LLMs by conducting experiments with consistent metrics and benchmarks. Additionally, we review related works and outline potential research directions to address these limitations. Our survey highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods. To foster future research, we have released the complementary materials publicly in https://github.com/MiuLab/EditLLM-Survey.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on a large amount of corpus, have demonstrated remarkable abilities. However, it may not be sufficient to directly apply open-source LLMs like Llama to certain real-world scenarios, since most of them are trained for \emph{general} purposes. Thus, the demands for customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently under-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new human preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new preference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization. Drawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed as a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum of two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train the LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human preference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making the application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to the residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the pre-trained LLM and the \emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function $r_1$. Moreover, we find that for a fixed pre-trained LLM, the reward function $r_2$ can be derived from the residual Q-function, enabling us to directly learn the residual Q-function from the new human preference data upon the Bradley-Terry model. We name our method Q-Adapter as it introduces an adapter module to approximate the residual Q-function for customizing the pre-trained LLM towards the new preference. Experiments based on the Llama-3.1 model on the DSP dataset and HH-RLHF dataset illustrate the superior effectiveness of Q-Adapter on both retaining existing knowledge and learning new preferences.

To alleviate this issue, we propose SharedLLM, a novel approach grounded in the design philosophy of multi-grained context compression and query-aware information retrieval. SharedLLM is composed of two short-context LLMs such as LLaMA-2, termed upper model and lower model. The lower model functions as a compressor while the upper model acts as a decoder. The upper model receives compressed, multi-grained context information from the lower model and performs context-aware modeling on the running text. Information transfer between the compressor and decoder occurs only at the lowest layers to refrain from long forward paths in the lower model and redundant cross-attention modules in the upper model. Based on this architecture, we introduce a specialized tree-style data structure to efficiently encode, store and retrieve multi-grained contextual information for text chunks. This structure, combined with a search algorithm, enables rapid encoding and retrieval of relevant information from various levels of the tree based on the input query. This entire process, wherein the sender and receiver are derived from the same LLM layer, is referred to as self-injection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing fairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue dataset, \texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show the current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel approach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts, calling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption of \texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) is a widely used objective for training deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In the neuroscience literature, an identical objective is known as the variational free energy, hinting at a potential unified framework for brain function and machine learning. Despite its utility in interpreting generative models, including diffusion models, ELBO maximization is often seen as too broad to offer prescriptive guidance for specific architectures in neuroscience or machine learning. In this work, we show that maximizing ELBO under Poisson assumptions for general sequence data leads to a spiking neural network that performs Bayesian posterior inference through its membrane potential dynamics. The resulting model, the iterative Poisson VAE (iP-VAE), has a closer connection to biological neurons than previous brain-inspired predictive coding models based on Gaussian assumptions. Compared to amortized and iterative VAEs, iP-VAElearns sparser representations and exhibits superior generalization to out-of-distribution samples. These findings suggest that optimizing ELBO, combined with Poisson assumptions, provides a solid foundation for developing prescriptive theories in NeuroAI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been reliably integrated with visual input for multimodal tasks. The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that finetuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best tradeoff between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC$^0$, making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. Our work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. We provide both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Financial intelligence generation from vast data sources has typically relied on traditional methods of knowledge-graph construction or database engineering. Recently, fine-tuned financial domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), have emerged. While these advancements are promising, limitations such as high inference costs, hallucinations, and the complexity of concurrently analyzing high-dimensional financial data, emerge. This motivates our invention FISHNET (Financial Intelligence from Sub-querying, Harmonizing, Neural-Conditioning, Expert swarming, and Task planning), an agentic architecture that accomplishes highly complex analytical tasks for more than 98,000 regulatory filings that vary immensely in terms of semantics, data hierarchy, or format. FISHNET shows remarkable performance for financial insight generation (61.8% success rate over 5.0% Routing, 45.6% RAG R-Precision). We conduct rigorous ablations to empirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the optimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be leveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and data integrity that are critical for financial tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, existing methods typically optimize a scalar score or ranking reward, thereby overlooking the multi-dimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we propose to extend the preference of DPO to two dimensions: segments and aspects. We first introduce a 2D supervision dataset called HelpSteer-2D. For the segment dimension, we divide the response into sentences and assign scores to each segment. For the aspect dimension, we meticulously design several criteria covering the response quality rubrics. With the 2-dimensional signals as feedback, we develop a 2D-DPO framework, decomposing the overall objective into multi-segment and multi-aspect objectives. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-DPO performs better than methods that optimize for scalar or 1-dimensional preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate reward engineering by leveraging their broad domain knowledge across various tasks. However, they often need many iterations of trial-and-error to generate effective reward functions. This process is costly because evaluating every sampled reward function requires completing the full policy optimization process for each function. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-driven reward generation framework that is able to produce state-of-the-art policies on the challenging Bi-DexHands benchmark with 20x fewer reward function samples than the prior state-of-the-art work. Our key insight is that we reduce the problem of generating task-specific rewards to the problem of coarsely estimating task progress. Our two-step solution leverages the task domain knowledge and the code synthesis abilities of LLMs to author progress functions that estimate task progress from a given state. Then, we use this notion of progress to discretize states, and generate count-based intrinsic rewards using the low-dimensional state space. We show that the combination of LLM-generated progress functions and count-based intrinsic rewards is essential for our performance gains, while alternatives such as generic hash-based counts or using progress directly as a reward function fall short.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This study explores the ability of Large Language Model (LLM) agents to detect and correct hallucinations in AI-generated content. A primary agent was tasked with creating a blog about a fictional Danish artist named Flipfloppidy, which was then reviewed by another agent for factual inaccuracies. Most LLMs hallucinated the existence of this artist. Across 4,900 test runs involving various combinations of primary and reviewing agents, advanced AI models such as Llama3-70b and GPT-4 variants demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in identifying hallucinations and successfully revised outputs in 85% to 100% of cases following feedback. These findings underscore the potential of advanced AI models to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated content, providing a promising approach to improving AI workflow orchestration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding. However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating diverse and effective clarifying questions is crucial for improving query understanding and retrieval performance in open-domain conversational search (CS) systems. We propose AGENT-CQ (Automatic GENeration, and evaluaTion of Clarifying Questions), an end-to-end LLM-based framework addressing the challenges of scalability and adaptability faced by existing methods that rely on manual curation or template-based approaches. AGENT-CQ consists of two stages: a generation stage employing LLM prompting strategies to generate clarifying questions, and an evaluation stage (CrowdLLM) that simulates human crowdsourcing judgments using multiple LLM instances to assess generated questions and answers based on comprehensive quality metrics. Extensive experiments on the ClariQ dataset demonstrate CrowdLLM's effectiveness in evaluating question and answer quality. Human evaluation and CrowdLLM show that the AGENT-CQ - generation stage, consistently outperforms baselines in various aspects of question and answer quality. In retrieval-based evaluation, LLM-generated questions significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness for both BM25 and cross-encoder models compared to human-generated questions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while Llama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing fully automated, end-to-end penetration testing. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks in different domains. However, their performance in closed-book biomedical machine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth. In this work, we evaluate GPT on four closed-book biomedical MRC benchmarks. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting method. To solve some of the retrieval problems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector databases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups. Moreover, we report qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get the best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of them. Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot setting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) has become common practice, often yielding numerous copies of the same LLM differing only in their LoRA updates. This paradigm presents challenges for systems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different LoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require continuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store thousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the efficacy of model compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for joint compression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling matrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are more amenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA collections. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed LoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic serving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput of serving a single LoRA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Home robots performing personalized tasks must adeptly balance user preferences with environmental affordances. We focus on organization tasks within constrained spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges. First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. Instruction, data, and code triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability issue, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, $C^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). Quantitative results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperforms nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, an LLM user study revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at an anonymized project site, with ample qualitative examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM plans out concise solution steps from the intent combined with few-shot prompting. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding solution steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought of code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present CoqPilot, a VS Code extension designed to help automate writing of Coq proofs. The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities. Demo of CoqPilot is available at: https://youtu.be/oB1Lx-So9Lo. Code at: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/coqpilot

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Almost all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models, except in one case involving fine-tuning using a substantial amount of human behavior data. Causes of failure are diverse, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results caution against using LLMs to study human behaviors or as human surrogates.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sensing will be a key technology in 6G networks, enabling a plethora of new sensing-enabled use cases. Some of the use cases relate to deployments over a wide physical area that needs to be sensed by multiple sensing sources at different locations. The efficient management of the sensing resources is pivotal for sustainable sensing-enabled mobile network designs. In this paper, we provide an example of such use case, and show the energy consumption due to sensing has potential to scale to prohibitive levels. We then propose architectural enhancements to solve this problem, and discuss energy saving and energy efficient strategies in sensing, that can only be properly quantified and applied with the proposed architectural enhancements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Like spoken languages, a single sign language expression could correspond to multiple valid textual interpretations. Hence, learning a rigid one-to-one mapping for sign language translation (SLT) models might be inadequate, particularly in the case of limited data. In this work, we introduce a Diverse Sign Language Translation (DivSLT) task, aiming to generate diverse yet accurate translations for sign language videos. Firstly, we employ large language models (LLM) to generate multiple references for the widely-used CSL-Daily and PHOENIX14T SLT datasets. Here, native speakers are only invited to touch up inaccurate references, thus significantly improving the annotation efficiency. Secondly, we provide a benchmark model to spur research in this task. Specifically, we investigate multi-reference training strategies to enable our DivSLT model to achieve diverse translations. Then, to enhance translation accuracy, we employ the max-reward-driven reinforcement learning objective that maximizes the reward of the translated result. Additionally, we utilize multiple metrics to assess the accuracy, diversity, and semantic precision of the DivSLT task. Experimental results on the enriched datasets demonstrate that our DivSLT method achieves not only better translation performance but also diverse translation results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but often face limited research focus due to their low prevalence. This results in prolonged diagnoses and a lack of approved therapies. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering potential to improve medical diagnosis and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning rare diseases, and struggle to handle the latest rare disease information. They also cannot effectively manage rare disease data and are not directly suitable for diagnosis and management tasks. Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of information from medical texts about rare diseases, focusing on entities and their relations. AutoRD integrates up-to-date structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Federal Funds rate in the United States plays a significant role in both domestic and international financial markets. However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts. Given that few studies have focused on employing LLM agents to simulate large-scale real-world conferences, our work can serve as a benchmark for future developments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have demonstrated success in optimizing resource allocation for large beneficiary populations in public health settings. Unfortunately, RMAB models lack flexibility to adapt to evolving public health policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept automated planners across domains of robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI, yet they encounter the challenge of efficient updates. Model editing enables the manipulation of specific knowledge memories and the behavior of language generation without retraining. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment between the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs may employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment has been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and linguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons (ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of individual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored. In this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial neurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational structure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns from temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as fixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain activity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This framework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of brain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs (BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with sub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of well-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs evolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved balance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of functional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of brain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to inform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human brain principles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing fairness benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on simple tasks, such as multiple-choice questions, overlooking biases that may arise in more complex scenarios like long-text generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates biases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our evaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two key patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic groups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses while neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a finetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. FT-REGARD reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Satellites are increasingly adopting on-board AI to optimize operations and increase autonomy through in-orbit inference. The use of Deep Learning (DL) models for segmentation in hyperspectral imagery offers advantages for remote sensing applications. In this work, we train and test 20 models for multi-class segmentation in hyperspectral imagery, selected for their potential in future space deployment. These models include 1D and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the latest vision transformers (ViTs). We propose a lightweight 1D-CNN model, 1D-Justo-LiuNet, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in the hypespectral domain. 1D-Justo-LiuNet exceeds the performance of 2D-CNN UNets and outperforms Apple's lightweight vision transformers designed for mobile inference. 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy (0.93) with the smallest model size (4,563 parameters) among all tested models, while maintaining fast inference. Unlike 2D-CNNs and ViTs, which encode both spectral and spatial information, 1D-Justo-LiuNet focuses solely on the rich spectral features in hyperspectral data, benefitting from the high-dimensional feature space. Our findings are validated across various satellite datasets, with the HYPSO-1 mission serving as the primary case study for sea, land, and cloud segmentation. We further confirm our conclusions through generalization tests on other hyperspectral missions, such as NASA's EO-1. Based on its superior performance and compact size, we conclude that 1D-Justo-LiuNet is highly suitable for in-orbit deployment, providing an effective solution for optimizing and automating satellite operations at edge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of social media has amplified the spread of fake news, now further complicated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which ease the generation of highly convincing, error-free misinformation, making it increasingly challenging for the public to discern truth from falsehood. Traditional fake news detection methods relying on linguistic cues also becomes less effective. Moreover, current detectors primarily focus on binary classification and English texts, often overlooking the distinction between machine-generated true vs. fake news and the detection in low-resource languages. To this end, we updated detection schema to include machine-generated news with focus on the Urdu language. We further propose a hierarchical detection strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness. Experiments show its effectiveness across four datasets in various settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Color center platforms have been at the forefront of quantum nanophotonics for applications in quantum networking, computing, and sensing. However, large-scale deployment of this technology has been stifled by a lack of ability to integrate photonic devices at scale while maintaining the properties of quantum emitters. We address this challenge in silicon carbide which has both commercially available wafer-scale substrates and is a host to color centers with desirable optical and spin properties. Using ion beam etching at an angle, we develop a 5-inch wafer process for the fabrication of triangular cross-section photonic devices in bulk 4H-SiC. The developed process has a variability in etch rate and etch angle of 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated color centers maintain their optical properties after the etch, thus achieving the nanofabrication goal of wafer-scale nanofabrication in quantum-grade silicon carbide.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to high inference costs and memory requirements. To address these issues, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a popular method for model compression, with student-generated outputs (SGOs) being particularly notable for reducing the mismatch between training and inference. However, SGOs often produce noisy and biased sequences, which can lead to misguidance from the teacher model, especially in long sequences. To mitigate these challenges, we propose SWITCH (Studying WIth TeaCHer for Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach that strategically incorporates the teacher model during the student's sequence generation. SWITCH identifies discrepancies between the token probabilities of the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher to intervene selectively, particularly in long sequences that are more prone to teacher misguidance. Extensive experimental results across three model families and five instruction-following datasets show that SWITCH surpasses traditional KD methods, particularly excelling in the generation of long sequential data.

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have evolved to process multiple modalities beyond text, such as images and audio, which motivates us to explore how to effectively leverage them for graph machine learning tasks. The key question, therefore, is how to transform graphs into linear sequences of tokens, a process we term graph linearization, so that LLMs can handle graphs naturally. We consider that graphs should be linearized meaningfully to reflect certain properties of natural language text, such as local dependency and global alignment, in order to ease contemporary LLMs, trained on trillions of textual tokens, better understand graphs. To achieve this, we developed several graph linearization methods based on graph centrality, degeneracy, and node relabeling schemes. We then investigated their effect on LLM performance in graph reasoning tasks. Experimental results on synthetic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods compared to random linearization baselines. Our work introduces novel graph representations suitable for LLMs, contributing to the potential integration of graph machine learning with the trend of multi-modal processing using a unified transformer model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved a degree of success in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, yet they remain prone to a significant challenge known as hallucination: producing information that is not substantiated by the input or external knowledge. Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations have focused on techniques such as fine-tuning models on high-quality datasets, incorporating fact-checking mechanisms, and developing adversarial training methods. While these approaches have shown some promise, they often address the issue at the level of individual model outputs, leaving unexplored the effects of inter-model interactions on hallucination. This study investigates the phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs through a novel experimental framework where multiple instances of GPT-4o-Mini models engage in a debate-like interaction prompted with questions from the TruthfulQA dataset. One model is deliberately instructed to generate plausible but false answers while the other models are asked to respond truthfully. The experiment is designed to assess whether the introduction of misinformation by one model can challenge the truthful majority to better justify their reasoning, improving performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark. The findings suggest that inter-model interactions can offer valuable insights into improving the accuracy and robustness of LLM outputs, complementing existing mitigation strategies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recent popular radiance field models, exemplified by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), Instant-NGP and 3D Gaussian Splat?ting, are designed to represent 3D content by that training models for each individual scene. This unique characteristic of scene representation and per-scene training distinguishes radiance field models from other neural models, because complex scenes necessitate models with higher representational capacity and vice versa. In this paper, we propose content?aware radiance fields, aligning the model complexity with the scene intricacies through Adversarial Content-Aware Quantization (A-CAQ). Specifically, we make the bitwidth of parameters differentiable and train?able, tailored to the unique characteristics of specific scenes and requirements. The proposed framework has been assessed on Instant-NGP, a well-known NeRF variant and evaluated using various datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a notable reduction in computational complexity, while preserving the requisite reconstruction and rendering quality, making it beneficial for practical deployment of radiance fields models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to memorizing training data, raising concerns due to the potential extraction of sensitive information. Current methods to measure memorization rates of LLMs, primarily discoverable extraction (Carlini et al., 2022), rely on single-sequence greedy sampling, potentially underestimating the true extent of memorization. This paper introduces a probabilistic relaxation of discoverable extraction that quantifies the probability of extracting a target sequence within a set of generated samples, considering various sampling schemes and multiple attempts. This approach addresses the limitations of reporting memorization rates through discoverable extraction by accounting for the probabilistic nature of LLMs and user interaction patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that this probabilistic measure can reveal cases of higher memorization rates compared to rates found through discoverable extraction. We further investigate the impact of different sampling schemes on extractability, providing a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of LLM memorization and its associated risks. Our contributions include a new probabilistic memorization definition, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and a thorough evaluation across different models, sizes, sampling schemes, and training data repetitions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous agents operating on the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of various applications hold immense practical value. Unlike the large language model (LLM)-based methods which rely on structured texts and customized backends, the approaches using large vision-language models (LVLMs) are more intuitive and adaptable as they can visually perceive and directly interact with screens, making them indispensable in general scenarios without text metadata and tailored backends. Given the lack of high-quality training data for GUI-related tasks in existing work, this paper aims to enhance the GUI understanding and interacting capabilities of LVLMs through a data-driven approach. We propose EDGE, a general data synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale, multi-granularity training data from webpages across the Web. Evaluation results on various GUI and agent benchmarks demonstrate that the model trained with the dataset generated through EDGE exhibits superior webpage understanding capabilities, which can then be easily transferred to previously unseen desktop and mobile environments. Our approach significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotations, empowering researchers to harness the vast public resources available on the Web to advance their work. Our source code, the dataset and the model are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDGE-1CDB.

We assess these factors on popular cloud services using metrics such as loss per dollar and tokens per second. Our findings aim to support the broader adoption and optimization of language model training for low-resource AI research institutes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can rapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a performance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant ones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation. Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, \textbf{Co}llaborative \textbf{Lo}RA (CoRA), with a collaborative query generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings and inject them into a set number of learnable queries. We then convert collaborative queries into collaborative weights with low-rank properties and merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transition pathways for Europe to achieve carbon neutrality emphasize the need for a massive deployment of solar and wind energy. Global cost optimization would lead to installing most of the renewable capacity in a few resource-rich countries, but policy decisions could prioritize other factors. In this study, we focus on the effect of energy independence on Europe's energy system design. We show that self-sufficiency constraints lead to a more equitable distribution of costs and installed capacities across Europe. However, countries that typically depend on energy imports face cost increases of up to 150% to achieve complete self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency particularly favours solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, and with declining PV module prices, alternative configurations like inverter dimensioning and horizontal tracking are beneficial enough to be part of the optimal solution for many countries. Moreover, we found that very large solar and wind annual installation rates are required, but they seem feasible in light of recent historical trends.

Detecting duplicate and near-duplicate photographs can reduce the time spent on manual annotation by archivists. This real use case differs from laboratory settings as the deployment dataset is available in advance, allowing the use of transductive learning. We propose a transductive learning approach that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Our approach involves pre-training a deep neural network on a large dataset and then fine-tuning the network on the unlabeled target collection with self-supervised learning. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods in the task of near-duplicate image detection in the UKBench and an in-house private dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The notable success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked an upsurge in building language agents to complete various complex tasks. We present AMOR, an agent framework based on open-source LLMs, which reasons with external knowledge bases and adapts to specific domains through human supervision to the reasoning process. AMOR builds reasoning logic over a finite state machine (FSM) that solves problems through autonomous executions and transitions over disentangled modules. This allows humans to provide direct feedback to the individual modules, and thus naturally forms process supervision. Based on this reasoning and feedback framework, we develop AMOR through two-stage fine-tuning: warm-up and adaptation. The former fine-tunes the LLM with examples automatically constructed from various public datasets, enabling AMOR to generalize across different knowledge environments, while the latter tailors AMOR to specific domains using process feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the advantage of AMOR to strong baselines, thanks to its FSM-based reasoning and process feedback mechanism.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-To-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated the ability to generate compelling text and visual stories. However, their outputs are predominantly aligned with the sensibilities of the Global North, often resulting in an outsider's gaze on other cultures. As a result, non-Western communities have to put extra effort into generating culturally specific stories. To address this challenge, we developed a visual storytelling pipeline called KAHANI that generates culturally grounded visual stories for non-Western cultures. Our pipeline leverages off-the-shelf models GPT-4 Turbo and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). By using Chain of Thought (CoT) and T2I prompting techniques, we capture the cultural context from user's prompt and generate vivid descriptions of the characters and scene compositions. To evaluate the effectiveness of KAHANI, we conducted a comparative user study with ChatGPT-4 (with DALL-E3) in which participants from different regions of India compared the cultural relevance of stories generated by the two tools. Results from the qualitative and quantitative analysis performed on the user study showed that KAHANI was able to capture and incorporate more Culturally Specific Items (CSIs) compared to ChatGPT-4. In terms of both its cultural competence and visual story generation quality, our pipeline outperformed ChatGPT-4 in 27 out of the 36 comparisons.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier's ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As language models (LMs) approach human-level performance, a comprehensive understanding of their behavior becomes crucial. This includes evaluating capabilities, biases, task performance, and alignment with societal values. Extensive initial evaluations, including red teaming and diverse benchmarking, can establish a model's behavioral profile. However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present a method for continual Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs. Building on recent work in hypothesis testing, our auditing test detects behavioral shifts solely through model generations. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases. We evaluate our approach using two case studies: monitoring changes in (a) toxicity and (b) translation performance. We find that the test is able to detect meaningful changes in behavior distributions using just hundreds of examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-signal implementations of SNNs offer a promising solution to edge computing applications that require low-power and compact embedded processing systems. However, device mismatch in the analog circuits of these neuromorphic processors poses a significant challenge to the deployment of robust processing in these systems. Here we introduce a novel architectural solution inspired by biological development to address this issue. Specifically we propose to implement architectures that incorporate network motifs found in developed brains through a differentiable re-parameterization of weight matrices based on gene expression patterns and genetic rules. Thanks to the gradient descent optimization compatibility of the method proposed, we can apply the robustness of biological neural development to neuromorphic computing.   To validate this approach we benchmark it using the Yin-Yang classification dataset, and compare its performance with that of standard multilayer perceptrons trained with state-of-the-art hardware-aware training method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method mitigates mismatch-induced noise without requiring precise device mismatch measurements, effectively outperforming alternative hardware-aware techniques proposed in the literature, and providing a more general solution for improving the robustness of SNNs in neuromorphic hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are being used in data science code generation tasks, but they often struggle with complex sequential tasks, leading to logical errors. Their application to geospatial data processing is particularly challenging due to difficulties in incorporating complex data structures and spatial constraints, effectively utilizing diverse function calls, and the tendency to hallucinate less-used geospatial libraries. To tackle these problems, we introduce GeoAgent, a new interactive framework designed to help LLMs handle geospatial data processing more effectively. GeoAgent pioneers the integration of a code interpreter, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, offering a novel approach to geospatial data processing. In addition, we contribute a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the LLM-based approach in geospatial tasks. This benchmark leverages a variety of Python libraries and includes both single-turn and multi-turn tasks such as data acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. By offering a comprehensive evaluation among diverse geospatial contexts, this benchmark sets a new standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks. Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the proposed GeoAgent has demonstrated superior performance, yielding notable improvements in function calls and task completion. In addition, these results offer valuable insights for the future development of LLM agents in automatic geospatial data analysis task programming.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transfer learning has gained significant attention in recent deep learning research due to its ability to accelerate convergence and enhance performance on new tasks. However, its success is often contingent on the similarity between source and target data, and training on numerous datasets can be costly, leading to blind selection of pretrained models with limited insight into their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce D2NWG, a diffusion-based neural network weights generation technique that efficiently produces high-performing weights for transfer learning, conditioned on the target dataset. Our method extends generative hyper-representation learning to recast the latent diffusion paradigm for neural network weights generation, learning the weight distributions of models pretrained on various datasets. This allows for automatic generation of weights that generalize well across both seen and unseen tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art meta-learning methods and pretrained models. Moreover, our approach is scalable to large architectures such as large language models (LLMs), overcoming the limitations of current parameter generation techniques that rely on task-specific model collections or access to original training data. By modeling the parameter distribution of LLMs, D2NWG enables task-specific parameter generation without requiring additional fine-tuning or large collections of model variants. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently enhances the performance of diverse base models, regardless of their size or complexity, positioning it as a robust solution for scalable transfer learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful computational models trained on extensive corpora of human-readable text, enabling them to perform general-purpose language understanding and generation. LLMs have garnered significant attention in both industry and academia due to their exceptional performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these successes, LLMs often produce inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prompt engineering, the process of designing and formulating instructions for LLMs to perform specific tasks, has emerged as a key approach to mitigating hallucinations. This paper provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of different prompting strategies and frameworks aimed at reducing hallucinations in LLMs. Various prompting techniques are applied to a broad set of benchmark datasets to assess the accuracy and hallucination rate of each method. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of tool-calling agents (LLMs augmented with external tools to enhance their capabilities beyond language generation) on hallucination rates in the same benchmarks. The findings demonstrate that the optimal prompting technique depends on the type of problem, and that simpler techniques often outperform more complex methods in reducing hallucinations. Furthermore, it is shown that LLM agents can exhibit significantly higher hallucination rates due to the added complexity of external tool usage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multi-task performance. Therefore, researchers have been seeking to integrate LLMs in the broad sense of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) field. Different from the traditional method of cascading LLMs to process text generated by Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), new efforts have focused on designing architectures centered around Audio Feature Extraction - Multimodal Information Fusion - LLM Inference(Speech LLMs). This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while simultaneously facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures and training strategies. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses Speech LLMs' advancements in Rich Audio Transcription and its potential for Cross-task Integration within the SLU field. Additionally, it indicates key challenges uncovered through experimentation, such as the Dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further delves into the training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposing potential solutions based on these findings, and offering valuable insights and references for future research in this domain, as well as LLM applications in multimodal contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance across various language understanding tasks. While emerging benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs in various domains such as mathematics and computer science, they merely measure the accuracy in terms of the final prediction on multi-choice questions. However, it remains insufficient to verify the essential understanding of LLMs given a chosen choice. To fill this gap, we present CLR-Bench to comprehensively evaluate the LLMs in complex college-level reasoning. Specifically, (i) we prioritize 16 challenging college disciplines in computer science and artificial intelligence. The dataset contains 5 types of questions, while each question is associated with detailed explanations from experts. (ii) To quantify a fair evaluation of LLMs' reasoning ability, we formalize the criteria with two novel metrics. Q$\rightarrow$A is utilized to measure the performance of direct answer prediction, and Q$\rightarrow$AR effectively considers the joint ability to answer the question and provide rationale simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted with 40 LLMs over 1,018 discipline-specific questions. The results demonstrate the key insights that LLMs, even the best closed-source LLM, i.e., GPT-4 turbo, tend to `guess' the college-level answers. It shows a dramatic decrease in accuracy from 63.31% Q$\rightarrow$A to 39.00% Q$\rightarrow$AR, indicating an unsatisfactory reasoning ability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a more computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, DPO and its variants remain sensitive to hyper-parameters and prone to instability, particularly on mathematical datasets. We argue that these issues arise from the unidirectional likelihood-derivative negative feedback inherent in the log-likelihood loss function. To address this, we propose a novel LLM alignment loss that establishes a stable Bidirectional Negative Feedback (BNF) during optimization. Our proposed BNF loss eliminates the need for pairwise contrastive losses and does not require any extra tunable hyper-parameters or pairwise preference data, streamlining the alignment pipeline to be as simple as supervised fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments across two challenging QA benchmarks and four reasoning benchmarks. The experimental results show that BNF achieves comparable performance to the best methods on QA benchmarks, while its performance decrease on the four reasoning benchmarks is significantly lower compared to the best methods, thus striking a better balance between value alignment and reasoning ability. In addition, we further validate the performance of BNF on non-pairwise datasets, and conduct in-depth analysis of log-likelihood and logit shifts across different preference optimization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating text and numbers effectively is a crucial step towards enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) capabilities in assisting in scientific tasks. While most current approaches rely on discrete tokenization of numbers, for instance, conversion to scientific notation or base 10-decomposition, a recent approach proposed a continuous numerical encoding as an inductive bias. In this paper, we build upon this approach by introducing more expressive numerical embeddings. Our method addresses key shortcomings, including the elimination of numerical artefacts and the ability to handle a wide range of magnitudes without clipping.   Our work presents two key contributions. First, we employ an MLP to assign distinct directions in the embedding space to different numbers. Our second contribution is the introduction of a routing layer that differentiates between numerical and text embeddings. We hypothesise that this combined approach enables the model to distinguish between text and number distributions while maintaining its capacity for arithmetic operations.   Using only a 45 M parameter encoder-decoder architecture our method achieves a $R^2$=0.9988 over a wide range of magnitude ($10^{-3},10^{8}$). In addition, we empirically observe a reduction of the numerical artefacts and biases observed compared to the baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged to empower autonomous agents to simulate human beings in various fields of behavioral research. However, evaluating their capacity to navigate complex social interactions remains a challenge. Previous studies face limitations due to insufficient scenario diversity, complexity, and a single-perspective focus. To this end, we introduce AgentSense: Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Language Agents through Interactive Scenarios. Drawing on Dramaturgical Theory, AgentSense employs a bottom-up approach to create 1,225 diverse social scenarios constructed from extensive scripts. We evaluate LLM-driven agents through multi-turn interactions, emphasizing both goal completion and implicit reasoning. We analyze goals using ERG theory and conduct comprehensive experiments. Our findings highlight that LLMs struggle with goals in complex social scenarios, especially high-level growth needs, and even GPT-4o requires improvement in private information reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advancements in multimodal learning, particularly in video understanding and generation, require high-quality video-text datasets for improved model performance. Vript addresses this issue with a meticulously annotated corpus of 12K high-resolution videos, offering detailed, dense, and script-like captions for over 420K clips. Each clip has a caption of ~145 words, which is over 10x longer than most video-text datasets. Unlike captions only documenting static content in previous datasets, we enhance video captioning to video scripting by documenting not just the content, but also the camera operations, which include the shot types (medium shot, close-up, etc) and camera movements (panning, tilting, etc). By utilizing the Vript, we explore three training paradigms of aligning more text with the video modality rather than clip-caption pairs. This results in Vriptor, a top-performing video captioning model among open-source models, comparable to GPT-4V in performance. Vriptor is also a powerful model capable of end-to-end generation of dense and detailed captions for long videos. Moreover, we introduce Vript-Hard, a benchmark consisting of three video understanding tasks that are more challenging than existing benchmarks: Vript-HAL is the first benchmark evaluating action and object hallucinations in video LLMs, Vript-RR combines reasoning with retrieval resolving question ambiguity in long-video QAs, and Vript-ERO is a new task to evaluate the temporal understanding of events in long videos rather than actions in short videos in previous works. All code, models, and datasets are available in https://github.com/mutonix/Vript. PS: We have included more video-text datasets (Vript_CN & Vript_Multilingual) in the Vript series.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge editing is a rising technique for efficiently updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs) with minimal alteration of parameters. However, recent studies have identified side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. Despite these findings, evaluating the pitfalls of knowledge editing often relies on inconsistent metrics and benchmarks, lacking a uniform standard. In response, this survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified perspective on the challenges of knowledge editing in LLMs by conducting experiments with consistent metrics and benchmarks. Additionally, we review related works and outline potential research directions to address these limitations. Our survey highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods. To foster future research, we have released the complementary materials publicly in https://github.com/MiuLab/EditLLM-Survey.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of Large Language Models (LLM) has led researchers to explore Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for unified visual and linguistic understanding. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity of MLLM limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Small-scale MLLM (s-MLLM) aims to retain the capabilities of the large-scale model (l-MLLM) while reducing computational demands, but resulting in a significant decline in performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer knowledge from l-MLLM to s-MLLM. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal Distillation (MDist) to minimize the divergence between the visual-textual output distributions of l-MLLM and s-MLLM, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to transfer l-MLLM's ability to model correlations between visual features. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the potential of s-MLLM: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to align visual-textual representations, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the model with multimodal understanding, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to further transfer l-MLLM capabilities. Our approach significantly improves performance without altering the small model's architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on a large amount of corpus, have demonstrated remarkable abilities. However, it may not be sufficient to directly apply open-source LLMs like Llama to certain real-world scenarios, since most of them are trained for \emph{general} purposes. Thus, the demands for customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently under-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new human preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new preference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization. Drawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed as a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum of two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train the LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human preference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making the application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to the residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the pre-trained LLM and the \emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function $r_1$. Moreover, we find that for a fixed pre-trained LLM, the reward function $r_2$ can be derived from the residual Q-function, enabling us to directly learn the residual Q-function from the new human preference data upon the Bradley-Terry model. We name our method Q-Adapter as it introduces an adapter module to approximate the residual Q-function for customizing the pre-trained LLM towards the new preference. Experiments based on the Llama-3.1 model on the DSP dataset and HH-RLHF dataset illustrate the superior effectiveness of Q-Adapter on both retaining existing knowledge and learning new preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The acceleration of software development and delivery requires rigorous continuous testing and deployment of software systems, which are being deployed in increasingly diverse, complex, and dynamic environments. In recent years, the popularization of DevOps and integrated software forges like GitLab and GitHub has largely democratized Continuous Integration (CI) practices for a growing number of software. However, this trend intersects significantly with global energy consumption concerns and the growing demand for frugality in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. CI pipelines typically run in data centers which contribute significantly to the environmental footprint of ICT, yet there is little information available regarding their environmental impact. This article aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale analysis of the energy footprint of CI pipelines implemented with GitHub Actions and to provide a first overview of the energy impact of CI. We collect, instrument, and reproduce 838 workflows from 396 Java repositories hosted on GitHub to measure their energy consumption. We observe that the average unitary energy cost of a pipeline is relatively low, at 10 Wh. However, due to repeated invocations of these pipelines in real settings, the aggregated energy consumption cost per project is high, averaging 22 kWh. When evaluating CO2 emissions based on regional Wh-to-CO2 estimates, we observe that the average aggregated CO2 emissions are significant, averaging 10.5 kg. To put this into perspective, this is akin to the emissions produced by driving approximately 100 kilometers in a typical European car (110 gCO2/km). In light of our results, we advocate that developers should have the means to better anticipate and reflect on the environmental consequences of their CI choices when implementing DevOps practices.

While continual pre-training on long-context data is a straightforward and effective solution, it incurs substantial costs in terms of data acquisition and computational resources. To alleviate this issue, we propose SharedLLM, a novel approach grounded in the design philosophy of multi-grained context compression and query-aware information retrieval. SharedLLM is composed of two short-context LLMs such as LLaMA-2, termed upper model and lower model. The lower model functions as a compressor while the upper model acts as a decoder. The upper model receives compressed, multi-grained context information from the lower model and performs context-aware modeling on the running text. Information transfer between the compressor and decoder occurs only at the lowest layers to refrain from long forward paths in the lower model and redundant cross-attention modules in the upper model. Based on this architecture, we introduce a specialized tree-style data structure to efficiently encode, store and retrieve multi-grained contextual information for text chunks. This structure, combined with a search algorithm, enables rapid encoding and retrieval of relevant information from various levels of the tree based on the input query. This entire process, wherein the sender and receiver are derived from the same LLM layer, is referred to as self-injection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing fairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue dataset, \texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show the current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel approach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts, calling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption of \texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been reliably integrated with visual input for multimodal tasks. The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that finetuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best tradeoff between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in many scenarios, but their performance depends, in part, on the choice of prompt. Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLM) are leveraging human feedback to improve their generation quality. However, human feedback is costly to obtain, especially during inference. In this work, we propose LLMRefine, an inference time optimization method to refine LLM's output. The core idea is to use a learned fine-grained feedback model to pinpoint defects and guide LLM to refine them iteratively. Using original LLM as a proposal of edits, LLMRefine searches for defect-less text via simulated annealing, trading off the exploration and exploitation. We conduct experiments on three text generation tasks, including machine translation, long-form question answering (QA), and topical summarization. LLMRefine consistently outperforms all baseline approaches, achieving improvements up to 1.7 MetricX points on translation tasks, 8.1 ROUGE-L on ASQA, 2.2 ROUGE-L on topical summarization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional recommender systems rely on high-dimensional (latent) embeddings for modeling user-item interactions, often resulting in opaque representations that lack interpretability. Moreover, these systems offer limited control to users over their recommendations. Inspired by recent work, we introduce TExtuAl Representations for Scrutable recommendations (TEARS) to address these challenges. Instead of representing a user's interests through a latent embedding, TEARS encodes them in natural text, providing transparency and allowing users to edit them. To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user summaries based on user preferences. We find the summaries capture user preferences uniquely. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we use an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with the learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering. We find this approach can surpass the performance of three popular VAE models while providing user-controllable recommendations. We also analyze the controllability of TEARS through three simulated user tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of a user editing its summary.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) and dialogue agents represent a significant shift in artificial intelligence (AI) research, particularly with the recent release of the GPT family of models. ChatGPT's generative capabilities and versatility across technical and creative domains led to its widespread adoption, marking a departure from more limited deployments of previous AI systems. While society grapples with the emerging cultural impacts of this new societal-scale technology, critiques of ChatGPT's impact within machine learning research communities have coalesced around its performance or other conventional safety evaluations relating to bias, toxicity, and "hallucination." We argue that these critiques draw heavily on a particular conceptualization of the "human-centered" framework, which tends to cast atomized individuals as the key recipients of technology's benefits and detriments. In this article, we direct attention to another dimension of LLMs and dialogue agents' impact: their effects on social groups, institutions, and accompanying norms and practices. By analyzing ChatGPT's social impact through a social-centered framework, we challenge individualistic approaches in AI development and contribute to ongoing debates around the ethical and responsible deployment of AI systems. We hope this effort will call attention to more comprehensive and longitudinal evaluation tools (e.g., including more ethnographic analyses and participatory approaches) and compel technologists to complement human-centered thinking with social-centered approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dense retrievers are widely used in information retrieval and have also been successfully extended to other knowledge intensive areas such as language models, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unfortunately, they have recently been shown to be vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks in which a malicious user injects a small fraction of adversarial passages into the retrieval corpus to trick the system into returning these passages among the top-ranked results for a broad set of user queries. Further study is needed to understand the extent to which these attacks could limit the deployment of dense retrievers in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent (AGGD), a new attack on dense retrieval systems based on the widely used HotFlip method for efficiently generating adversarial passages. We demonstrate that AGGD can select a higher quality set of token-level perturbations than HotFlip by replacing its random token sampling with a more structured search. Experimentally, we show that our method achieves a high attack success rate on several datasets and using several retrievers, and can generalize to unseen queries and new domains. Notably, our method is extremely effective in attacking the ANCE retrieval model, achieving attack success rates that are 15.24\% and 17.44\% higher on the NQ and MS MARCO datasets, respectively, compared to HotFlip. Additionally, we demonstrate AGGD's potential to replace HotFlip in other adversarial attacks, such as knowledge poisoning of RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have identified one aggravating factor of LLM hallucinations as the knowledge inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning, where unfamiliar fine-tuning data mislead the LLM to fabricate plausible but wrong outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy called Prereq-Tune to address this knowledge inconsistency and reduce hallucinations. Fundamentally, Prereq-Tune disentangles the learning of skills and knowledge, so the model learns only the task skills without being impacted by the knowledge inconsistency. To achieve this, Prereq-Tune introduces an additional prerequisite learning stage to learn the necessary knowledge for SFT, allowing subsequent SFT to focus only on task skills. Prereq-Tune can also be combined with fictitious synthetic data to enhance the grounding of LLM outputs to their internal knowledge. Experiments show that Prereq-Tune outperforms existing baselines in improving LLM's factuality across short QA and long-form generation tasks. It also opens new possibilities for knowledge-controlled generation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Prereq_tune.git.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly trained on data generated by other LLM, either because generated text and images become part of the pre-training corpus, or because synthetized data is used as a replacement for expensive human-annotation. This raises concerns about \emph{model collapse}, a drop in model performance when their training sets include generated data. Considering that it is easier for both humans and machines to tell between good and bad examples than to generate high-quality samples, we investigate the use of verification on synthesized data to prevent model collapse. We provide a theoretical characterization using Gaussian mixtures, linear classifiers, and linear verifiers to derive conditions with measurable proxies to assess whether the verifier can effectively select synthesized data that leads to optimal performance. We experiment with two practical tasks -- computing matrix eigenvalues with transformers and news summarization with LLMs -- which both exhibit model collapse when trained on generated data, and show that verifiers, even imperfect ones, can indeed be harnessed to prevent model collapse and that our proposed proxy measure strongly correlates with performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relationships between entities within text. Despite considerable advancements, existing models predominantly require extensive annotated training data, which is both costly and labor-intensive to collect. Moreover, these models often struggle to adapt to new or unseen relations. Few-shot learning, aiming to lessen annotation demands, typically provides incomplete and biased supervision for target relations, leading to degraded and unstable performance. To accurately and explicitly describe relation semantics while minimizing annotation demands, we explore the definition only zero-shot RE setting where only relation definitions expressed in natural language are used to train a RE model. We introduce REPaL, comprising three stages: (1) We leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate initial seed instances from relation definitions and an unlabeled corpus. (2) We fine-tune a bidirectional Small Language Model (SLM) with initial seeds to learn relations for the target domain. (3) We expand pattern coverage and mitigate bias from initial seeds by integrating feedback from the SLM's predictions on the unlabeled corpus and the synthesis history. To accomplish this, we leverage the multi-turn conversation ability of LLMs to generate new instances in follow-up dialogues, informed by both the feedback and synthesis history. Studies reveal that definition-oriented seed synthesis enhances pattern coverage whereas indiscriminately increasing seed quantity leads to performance saturation. Experiments on two datasets show REPaL significantly improved cost-effective zero-shot performance by large margins.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current LLMs for creating fully-structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage issues when uploading data to external servers.We aim to develop an open-source, accurate LLM for creating fully-structured and standardized LCS reports from varying free-text reports across institutions and demonstrate its utility in automatic statistical analysis and individual lung nodule retrieval. With IRB approvals, our retrospective study included 5,442 de-identified LDCT LCS radiology reports from two institutions. We constructed two evaluation datasets by labeling 500 pairs of free-text and fully-structured radiology reports and one large-scale consecutive dataset from January 2021 to December 2023. Two radiologists created a standardized template for recording 27 lung nodule features on LCS. We designed a dynamic-template-constrained decoding method to enhance existing LLMs for creating fully-structured reports from free-text radiology reports. Using consecutive structured reports, we automated descriptive statistical analyses and a nodule retrieval prototype. Our best LLM for creating fully-structured reports achieved high performance on cross-institutional datasets with an F1 score of about 97%, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method consistently improved the best open-source LLMs by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%. The automatically derived statistical distributions were consistent with prior findings regarding attenuation, location, size, stability, and Lung-RADS. The retrieval system with structured reports allowed flexible nodule-level search and complex statistical analysis. Our developed software is publicly available for local deployment and further research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current autonomous building research primarily focuses on energy efficiency and automation. While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management hinder transparency in decision-making, limiting true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governance and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Large Language Models, and digital twins to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, AI-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rise of AI-generated content spewed at scale from large language models (LLMs), genuine concerns about the spread of fake news have intensified. The perceived ability of LLMs to produce convincing fake news at scale poses new challenges for both human and automated fake news detection systems. To address this gap, this work presents the findings from a university-level competition which aimed to explore how LLMs can be used by humans to create fake news, and to assess the ability of human annotators and AI models to detect it. A total of 110 participants used LLMs to create 252 unique fake news stories, and 84 annotators participated in the detection tasks. Our findings indicate that LLMs are ~68% more effective at detecting real news than humans. However, for fake news detection, the performance of LLMs and humans remains comparable (~60% accuracy). Additionally, we examine the impact of visual elements (e.g., pictures) in news on the accuracy of detecting fake news stories. Finally, we also examine various strategies used by fake news creators to enhance the credibility of their AI-generated content. This work highlights the increasing complexity of detecting AI-generated fake news, particularly in collaborative human-AI settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of automated programming, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated foundational generative capabilities when given detailed task descriptions. However, their current functionalities are primarily limited to function-level development, restricting their effectiveness in complex project environments and specific application scenarios, such as complicated image-processing tasks. This paper presents a multi-agent framework that utilises a hybrid set of LLMs, including GPT-4o and locally deployed open-source models, which collaboratively complete auto-programming tasks. Each agent plays a distinct role in the software development cycle, collectively forming a virtual organisation that works together to produce software products. By establishing a tree-structured thought distribution and development mechanism across project, module, and function levels, this framework offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for code generation. We evaluated our approach using benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that VisionCoder significantly outperforms existing methods in image processing auto-programming tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research introduces a novel methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable and psychometrically validated personalities to Large Language Models-Based Agents (Agents) using the Big Five personality framework. It seeks to overcome the constraints of human subject studies, proposing Agents as an accessible tool for social science inquiry. Through a series of four studies, this research demonstrates the feasibility of assigning psychometrically valid personality traits to Agents, enabling them to replicate complex human-like behaviors. The first study establishes an understanding of personality constructs and personality tests within the semantic space of an LLM. Two subsequent studies -- using empirical and simulated data -- illustrate the process of creating Agents and validate the results by showing strong correspondence between human and Agent answers to personality tests. The final study further corroborates this correspondence by using Agents to replicate known human correlations between personality traits and decision-making behaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby validating the effectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and its applicability to social and behavioral research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for scalable educational applications, but their use in dialog-based tutoring systems remains challenging due to the need for effective pedagogical strategies and the high costs associated with expert-curated datasets. Our study explores the use of smaller, more affordable LLMs for one-on-one tutoring in the context of solving reading comprehension problems. We developed a synthetic tutoring dialog dataset, evaluated by human teachers, and fine-tuned a smaller LLM using this dataset. Furthermore, we conducted an interactive experiment comparing the performance of the fine-tuned model with a larger model in real-world tutoring scenarios. Our results show that the fine-tuned model performs on par with the larger model but at a lower cost, demonstrating a viable, cost-effective approach for implementing LLM-based tutoring systems in educational settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper identifies and analyzes applications in which Large Language Models (LLMs) can make Internet of Things (IoT) networks more intelligent and responsive through three case studies from critical topics: DDoS attack detection, macroprogramming over IoT systems, and sensor data processing. Our results reveal that the GPT model under few-shot learning achieves 87.6% detection accuracy, whereas the fine-tuned GPT increases the value to 94.9%. Given a macroprogramming framework, the GPT model is capable of writing scripts using high-level functions from the framework to handle possible incidents. Moreover, the GPT model shows efficacy in processing a vast amount of sensor data by offering fast and high-quality responses, which comprise expected results and summarized insights. Overall, the model demonstrates its potential to power a natural language interface. We hope that researchers will find these case studies inspiring to develop further.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Narratives are widely recognized as a powerful tool for structuring information and facilitating comprehension of complex ideas in various domains such as science communication. This paper investigates whether incorporating narrative elements can assist Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex problems more effectively. We propose a novel approach, Story of Thought (SoT), integrating narrative structures into prompting techniques for problem-solving. This approach involves constructing narratives around problem statements and creating a framework to identify and organize relevant information. Our experiments show that using various LLMs with SoT consistently surpasses using them with other techniques on physics, chemistry, math, and biology questions in both the GPQA and JEEBench datasets. The narrative-based information curation process in SoT enhances problem comprehension by contextualizing critical in-domain information and highlighting causal relationships within the problem space.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Aligning Large Language Models (LLM) to address subjectivity and nuanced preference levels requires adequate flexibility and control, which can be a resource-intensive and time-consuming procedure. Existing training-time alignment methods require full re-training when a change is needed and inference-time ones typically require access to the reward model at each inference step. To address these limitations, we introduce inference-time model alignment method that learns encoded representations of preference dimensions, called \textit{Alignment Vectors} (AV). These representations are computed by subtraction of the base model from the aligned model as in model editing enabling dynamically adjusting the model behavior during inference through simple linear operations. Even though the preference dimensions can span various granularity levels, here we focus on three gradual response levels across three specialized domains: medical, legal, and financial, exemplifying its practical potential. This new alignment paradigm introduces adjustable preference knobs during inference, allowing users to tailor their LLM outputs while reducing the inference cost by half compared to the prompt engineering approach. Additionally, we find that AVs are transferable across different fine-tuning stages of the same model, demonstrating their flexibility. AVs also facilitate multidomain, diverse preference alignment, making the process 12x faster than the retraining approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in the prebunking of election misinformation. Using results from a preregistered two-wave experimental study of 4,293 U.S. registered voters conducted in August 2024, we show that LLM-assisted prebunking significantly reduced belief in specific election myths,with these effects persisting for at least one week. Confidence in election integrity was also increased post-treatment. Notably, the effect was consistent across partisan lines, even when controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors like conspiratorial thinking. LLM-assisted prebunking is a promising tool for rapidly responding to changing election misinformation narratives.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study how information propagates in decoder-only Transformers, which are the architectural backbone of most existing frontier large language models (LLMs). We rely on a theoretical signal propagation analysis -- specifically, we analyse the representations of the last token in the final layer of the Transformer, as this is the representation used for next-token prediction. Our analysis reveals a representational collapse phenomenon: we prove that certain distinct sequences of inputs to the Transformer can yield arbitrarily close representations in the final token. This effect is exacerbated by the low-precision floating-point formats frequently used in modern LLMs. As a result, the model is provably unable to respond to these sequences in different ways -- leading to errors in, e.g., tasks involving counting or copying. Further, we show that decoder-only Transformer language models can lose sensitivity to specific tokens in the input, which relates to the well-known phenomenon of over-squashing in graph neural networks. We provide empirical evidence supporting our claims on contemporary LLMs. Our theory also points to simple solutions towards ameliorating these issues.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align the LLMs' interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences. Recent advances have highlighted effective prompt design by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these methods faced limitations due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues, and often failed to capture complex, dynamic user behavior patterns. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), employing personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in personal PEFT parameters, users can own and use their LLMs individually. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with non-parametric knowledge from retrieval and profiles, adapting LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Further studies reveal OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different activity levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalized large language models (LLMs) aim to tailor interactions, content, and recommendations to individual user preferences. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods excel in performance and generalization, they are costly and limit communal benefits when used individually. To this end, we introduce Personalized Pieces (Per-Pcs), a framework that allows users to safely share and assemble personalized PEFT efficiently with collaborative efforts. Per-Pcs involves selecting sharers, breaking their PEFT into pieces, and training gates for each piece. These pieces are added to a pool, from which target users can select and assemble personalized PEFT using their history data. This approach preserves privacy and enables fine-grained user modeling without excessive storage and computation demands. Experimental results show Per-Pcs outperforms non-personalized and PEFT retrieval baselines, offering performance comparable to OPPU with significantly lower resource use across six tasks. Further analysis highlights Per-Pcs's robustness concerning sharer count and selection strategy, pieces sharing ratio, and scalability in computation time and storage space. Per-Pcs's modularity promotes safe sharing, making LLM personalization more efficient, effective, and widely accessible through collaborative efforts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of context retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of context type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores optimal architectures for evaluating the outputs of large language models (LLMs) using LLMs themselves. We propose a novel framework that interprets LLMs as advocates within an ensemble of interacting agents, allowing them to defend their answers and reach conclusions through a judge and jury system. This approach offers a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation process compared to traditional human-based assessments or automated metrics. We discuss the motivation behind this framework, its key components, and comparative advantages. We also present a probabilistic model to evaluate the error reduction achieved by iterative advocate systems. Finally, we outline experiments to validate the effectiveness of multi-advocate architectures and discuss future research directions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable performance of generative large language models (LLMs) on abstractive summarization, they face two significant challenges: their considerable size and tendency to hallucinate. Hallucinations are concerning because they erode reliability and raise safety issues. Pruning is a technique that reduces model size by removing redundant weights, enabling more efficient sparse inference. Pruned models yield downstream task performance comparable to the original, making them ideal alternatives when operating on a limited budget. However, the effect that pruning has upon hallucinations in abstractive summarization with LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we provide an extensive empirical study across five summarization datasets, two state-of-the-art pruning methods, and five instruction-tuned LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that hallucinations are less prevalent from pruned LLMs than the original models. Our analysis suggests that pruned models tend to depend more on the source document for summary generation. This leads to a higher lexical overlap between the generated summary and the source document, which could be a reason for the reduction in hallucination risk.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven considerable interest in fine-tuning them with domain-specific data to create specialized language models. Nevertheless, such domain-specific fine-tuning data often contains contextually sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). Direct fine-tuning of LLMs on this data without privacy protection poses a risk of data leakage of sensitive PII during inference time. To address this challenge, we introduce Contextual Privacy Protection Language Models (CPPLM), a novel paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while safeguarding inference-time data privacy. Our work offers a theoretical analysis for model design and benchmarks various techniques such as corpus curation, penalty-based unlikelihood in training loss, instruction-based tuning, etc. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. In particular, instruction tuning with both positive and negative examples stands out as a promising method, effectively protecting private data while enhancing the model's knowledge. Our work underscores the potential for Large Language Models as robust contextual privacy protection learners.
