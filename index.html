                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

                    <strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Priya, Arie Gurfinkel

                <div class="summary">
                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the potential of cryogenic computing and superconducting electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at ultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics, operating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconducting technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many spectral CT applications require accurate material decomposition. Existing material decomposition algorithms are often susceptible to significant noise magnification or, in the case of one-step model-based approaches, hampered by slow convergence rates and large computational requirements. In this work, we proposed a novel framework - spectral diffusion posterior sampling (spectral DPS) - for one-step reconstruction and multi-material decomposition, which combines sophisticated prior information captured by one-time unsupervised learning and an arbitrary analytic physical system model. Spectral DPS is built upon a general DPS framework for nonlinear inverse problems. Several strategies developed in previous work, including jumpstart sampling, Jacobian approximation, and multi-step likelihood updates are applied facilitate stable and accurate decompositions. The effectiveness of spectral DPS was evaluated on a simulated dual-layer and a kV-switching spectral system as well as on a physical cone-beam CT (CBCT) test bench. In simulation studies, spectral DPS improved PSNR by 27.49% to 71.93% over baseline DPS and by 26.53% to 57.30% over MBMD, depending on the the region of interest. In physical phantom study, spectral DPS achieved a <1% error in estimating the mean density in a homogeneous region. Compared with baseline DPS, spectral DPS effectively avoided generating false structures in the homogeneous phantom and reduced the variability around edges. Both simulation and physical phantom studies demonstrated the superior performance of spectral DPS for stable and accurate material decomposition.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To index the increasing volume of data, modern data indexes are typically stored on SSDs and cached in DRAM. However, searching such an index has resulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and inefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation of filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which involves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by modern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which demonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a NAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than complete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing existing circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We demonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command interface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU for more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for write buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O transmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of workloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45% energy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve significant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85% respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One key to enabling high-performance serverless computing is to mitigate cold-starts. Current solutions utilize a warm pool to keep function alive: a warm-start can be analogous to a CPU cache-hit. However, modern cache has multiple hierarchies and the last-level cache is shared among cores, whereas the warm pool is limited to a single tenant for security concerns. Also, the warm pool keep-alive policy can be further optimized using cache replacement algorithms. In this paper, we borrow practical optimizations from caching, and design FaasCamp, a caching-aided multi-tenant serverless computing framework. FaasCamp extends the single-tier warm pool into multi-tiers, with a reclaim pool introduced enabling secure function instance sharing among tenants. Also, FaasCamp leverages machine learning to approximate the optimal cache replacement policy to improve the warm rate. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments under multiple scenarios. The results show that FaasCamp can outperform existing platforms with minimal overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Do transformers "think ahead" during inference at a given position? It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping LLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs can be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and prefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform causal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments illustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.   In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present StarCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, StarCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement a StarCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that StarCache can balance highly skewed workloads with various key and value sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications, including large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems. The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applications with irregular data structures, data-dependent control flows and fine-grained data transfers (e.g., real-world graph computations) perform poorly on cache-based systems. We propose the UpDown accelerator that supports fine-grained execution with novel architecture mechanisms - lightweight threading, event-driven scheduling, efficient ultra-short threads, and split-transaction DRAM access with software-controlled synchronization. These hardware primitives support software programmable events, enabling high performance on diverse data structures and algorithms. UpDown also supports scalable performance; hardware replication enables programs to scale up performance. Evaluation results show UpDown's flexibility and scalability enable it to outperform CPUs on graph mining and analytics computations by up to 116-195x geomean speedup and more than 4x speedup over prior accelerators. We show that UpDown generates high memory parallelism (~4.6x over CPU) required for memory intensive graph computations. We present measurements that attribute the performance of UpDown (23x architectural advantage) to its individual architectural mechanisms. Finally, we also analyze the area and power cost of UpDown's mechanisms for software programmability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-memory computing promises to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck in computer systems by performing computations directly within the memory. Previous research has suggested using Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) for in-memory computing due to its non-volatility, low leakage power, high density, endurance, and commercial viability. This paper explores hierarchical in-memory computing, where different levels of the memory hierarchy are augmented with processing elements to optimize workload execution. The paper investigates processing in memory (PiM) using non-volatile STT-RAM and processing in cache (PiC) using volatile STT-RAM with relaxed retention, which helps mitigate STT-RAM's write latency and energy overheads. We analyze tradeoffs and overheads associated with data movement for PiC versus write overheads for PiM using STT-RAMs for various workloads. We examine workload characteristics, such as computational intensity and CPU-dependent workloads with limited instruction-level parallelism, and their impact on PiC/PiM tradeoffs. Using these workloads, we evaluate computing in STT-RAM versus SRAM at different cache hierarchy levels and explore the potential of heterogeneous STT-RAM cache architectures with various retention times for PiC and CPU-based computing. Our experiments reveal significant advantages of STT-RAM-based PiC over PiM for specific workloads. Finally, we describe open research problems in hierarchical in-memory computing architectures to further enhance this paradigm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Processing-in-cache (PiC) and Processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures, especially those utilizing bit-line computing, offer promising solutions to mitigate data movement bottlenecks within the memory hierarchy. While previous studies have explored the integration of compute units within individual memory levels, the complexity and potential overheads associated with these designs have often limited their capabilities. This paper introduces a novel PiC/PiM architecture, Concurrent Hierarchical In-Memory Processing (CHIME), which strategically incorporates heterogeneous compute units across multiple levels of the memory hierarchy. This design targets the efficient execution of diverse, domain-specific workloads by placing computations closest to the data where it optimizes performance, energy consumption, data movement costs, and area. CHIME employs STT-RAM due to its various advantages in PiC/PiM computing, such as high density, low leakage, and better resiliency to data corruption from activating multiple word lines. We demonstrate that CHIME enhances concurrency and improves compute unit utilization at each level of the memory hierarchy. We present strategies for exploring the design space, grouping, and placing the compute units across the memory hierarchy. Experiments reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art bit-line computing approaches, CHIME achieves significant speedup and energy savings of 57.95% and 78.23% for various domain-specific workloads, while reducing the overheads associated with single-level compute designs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relaxed retention (or volatile) spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) has been widely studied as a way to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency overheads. Given a relaxed retention time STT-RAM level one (L1) cache, we analyze the impacts of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) -- a common optimization in modern processors -- on STT-RAM L1 cache design. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require different retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in most STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention time needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core (ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time heterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We also propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to run an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention time requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the proposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall processor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prior studies have shown that the retention time of the non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) can be relaxed in order to reduce STT-RAM's write energy and latency. However, since different applications may require different retention times, STT-RAM retention times must be critically explored to satisfy various applications' needs. This process can be challenging due to exploration overhead, and exacerbated by the fact that STT-RAM caches are emerging and are not readily available for design time exploration. This paper explores using known and easily obtainable statistics (e.g., SRAM statistics) to predict the appropriate STT-RAM retention times, in order to minimize exploration overhead. We propose an STT-RAM Cache Retention Time (SCART) model, which utilizes machine learning to enable design time or runtime prediction of right-provisioned STT-RAM retention times for latency or energy optimization. Experimental results show that, on average, SCART can reduce the latency and energy by 20.34% and 29.12%, respectively, compared to a homogeneous retention time while reducing the exploration overheads by 52.58% compared to prior work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Colocating high-priority, latency-sensitive (LS) and low-priority, best-effort (BE) DNN inference services reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) of GPU clusters. Limited by bottlenecks such as VRAM channel conflicts and PCIe bus contentions, existing GPU sharing solutions are unable to avoid resource conflicts among concurrently executing tasks, failing to achieve both low latency for LS tasks and high throughput for BE tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Missile, a general GPU sharing solution for multi-tenant DNN inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Missile approximates fine-grained GPU hardware resource isolation between multiple LS and BE DNN tasks at software level. Through comprehensive reverse engineering, Missile first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. It also isolates the PCIe bus and fairly allocates PCIe bandwidth using completely fair scheduler. We evaluate 12 mainstream DNNs with synthetic and real-world workloads on four GPUs. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, Missile reduces tail latency for LS services by up to ~50%, achieves up to 6.1x BE job throughput, and allocates PCIe bus bandwidth to tenants on-demand for optimal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation quality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV stores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying hardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially running a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is accompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we introduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in heterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from its associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining their interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the downstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also ensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each other in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the caching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval. We deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its rapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Web caches play a crucial role in web performance and scalability. However, detecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably communicate the cache status through standardized headers. This paper presents a novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis. Our approach eliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any web server. The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP multiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the origin of the responses. By measuring the time it takes to receive responses from paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not. In each pair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server, while the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present. A faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the cache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We implemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging our cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the Tranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches (5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we employed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in these hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD vulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and highlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated cache status headers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores in a cacheline granularity. Alongside with unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.   In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. Using these transformations, every linearizable algorithm can be easily transformed into its provably correct version in the face of a full-system or sub-system crash. We believe that this work will serve as the stepping stone for systems design and modelling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only resource-intensive to train but even more costly to deploy in production. Therefore, recent work has attempted to prune blocks of LLMs based on cheap proxies for estimating block importance, effectively removing 10% of blocks in well-trained LLaMa-2 and Mistral 7b models without any significant degradation of downstream metrics. In this paper, we explore different block importance metrics by considering adaptive metrics such as Shapley value in addition to static ones explored in prior work. We show that adaptive metrics exhibit a trade-off in performance between tasks i.e., improvement on one task may degrade performance on the other due to differences in the computed block influences. Furthermore, we extend this analysis from a complete block to individual self-attention and feed-forward layers, highlighting the propensity of the self-attention layers to be more amendable to pruning, even allowing removal of upto 33% of the self-attention layers without incurring any performance degradation on MMLU for Mistral 7b (significant reduction in costly maintenance of KV-cache). Finally, we look at simple performance recovery techniques to emulate the pruned layers by training lightweight additive bias or low-rank linear adapters. Performance recovery using emulated updates avoids performance degradation for the initial blocks (up to 5% absolute improvement on MMLU), which is either competitive or superior to the learning-based technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various domains, processing millions of daily requests. This surge in demand poses significant challenges in optimizing throughput and latency while keeping costs manageable. The Key-Value (KV) cache, a standard method for retaining previous computations, makes LLM inference highly bounded by memory. While batching strategies can enhance performance, they frequently lead to significant memory fragmentation. Even though cutting-edge systems like vLLM mitigate KV cache fragmentation using paged Attention mechanisms, they still suffer from inefficient memory and computational operations due to the tightly coupled page management and computation kernels.   This study introduces the vTensor, an innovative tensor structure for LLM inference based on GPU virtual memory management (VMM). vTensor addresses existing limitations by decoupling computation from memory defragmentation and offering dynamic extensibility. Our framework employs a CPU-GPU heterogeneous approach, ensuring efficient, fragmentation-free memory management while accommodating various computation kernels across different LLM architectures. Experimental results indicate that vTensor achieves an average speedup of 1.86x across different models, with up to 2.42x in multi-turn chat scenarios. Additionally, vTensor provides average speedups of 2.12x and 3.15x in kernel evaluation, reaching up to 3.92x and 3.27x compared to SGLang Triton prefix-prefilling kernels and vLLM paged Attention kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it frees approximately 71.25% (57GB) of memory on the NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to vLLM, enabling more memory-intensive workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LSM-based key-value (KV) stores are an important component in modern data infrastructures. However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of several seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how they affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail latency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based on our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail latency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM reduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the tiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain length by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and introducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate it using db_bench and YCSB. Our evaluation highlights the underlying trade-off among memory requirements, I/O amplification, and tail latency, as well as the advantage of vLSM over current approaches. vLSM improves P99 tail latency by up to 4.8x for writes and by up to 12.5x for reads, reduces cumulative write stalls by up to 60% while also slightly improves I/O amplification at the same memory budget.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus provides a generic semantic framework for fixpoint logics over systems whose branching type goes beyond the standard relational setup, e.g. probabilistic, weighted, or game-based. Previous work on the coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus includes an exponential-time upper bound on satisfiability checking, which however relies on the availability of tableau rules for the next-step modalities that are sufficiently well-behaved in a formally defined sense; in particular, rule matches need to be representable by polynomial-sized codes, and the sequent duals of the rules need to absorb cut. While such rule sets have been identified for some important cases, they are not known to exist in all cases of interest, in particular ones involving either integer weights as in the graded $\mu$-calculus, or real-valued weights in combination with non-linear arithmetic. In the present work, we prove the same upper complexity bound under more general assumptions, specifically regarding the complexity of the (much simpler) satisfiability problem for the underlying one-step logic, roughly described as the nesting-free next-step fragment of the logic. The bound is realized by a generic global caching algorithm that supports on-the-fly satisfiability checking. Notably, our approach directly accommodates unguarded formulae, and thus avoids use of the guardedness transformation. Example applications include new exponential-time upper bounds for satisfiability checking in an extension of the graded $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities (including positive Presburger arithmetic), as well as an extension of the (two-valued) probabilistic $\mu$-calculus with polynomial inequalities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they often struggle with seemingly easy tasks like arithmetic despite their vast capabilities. This stark disparity raise human's concerns about their safe and ethical use, hinder their widespread adoption.In this paper, we focus on a typical arithmetic task, integer multiplication, to explore and explain the imperfection of transformers in this domain. We provide comprehensive analysis of a vanilla transformer trained to perform n-digit integer multiplication. Our observations indicate that the model decomposes multiplication task into multiple parallel subtasks, sequentially optimizing each subtask for each digit to complete the final multiplication. Based on observation and analysis, we infer the reasons of transformers deficiencies in multiplication tasks lies in their difficulty in calculating successive carryovers and caching intermediate results, and confirmed this inference through experiments. Guided by these findings, we propose improvements to enhance transformers performance on multiplication tasks. These enhancements are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, not only enhance transformer's interpretability, but also improve its performance, e.g., we achieve over 99.9% accuracy on 5-digit integer multiplication with a tiny transformer, outperform LLMs GPT-4. Our method contributes to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability, paving the way for analyzing more complex tasks and Transformer models. This work underscores the importance of explainable AI, helping to build trust in large language models and promoting their adoption in critical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a "compensation token" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used today in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and node/link classification tasks. Real world GNNs continue to scale in size and require a large memory footprint for storing graphs and embeddings that often exceed the memory capacities of the target GPUs used for training. To address limited memory capacities, traditional GNN training approaches use graph partitioning and sharding techniques to scale up across multiple GPUs within a node and/or scale out across multiple nodes. However, this approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning algorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.   To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU GNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that utilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function as a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid eviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and dynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance. Furthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a mechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU pinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices. Experimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and memory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior performance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x speed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The maximum supported context length is a critical bottleneck limiting the practical application of the Large Language Model (LLM). Although existing length extrapolation methods can extend the context of LLMs to millions of tokens, these methods all have an explicit upper bound. In this work, we propose LongCache, a training-free approach that enables LLM to support an infinite context with finite context scope, through full-context cache selection and training-free integration. This effectively frees LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate LongCache on the LongBench and L-Eval and demonstrate its performance is on par with traditional full-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we have applied LongCache on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3 and Mistral-v0.3, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 400K in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We will improve the efficiency of LongCache by GPU-aware optimization soon.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter efficiency limitations due to the substantial Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to evict non-critical cache elements during runtime, thereby reducing cache size within given memory budgets while preserving generation quality. Our reexamination of foundational principles reveals that prevailing methods aim to minimize an upper bound of eviction loss, quantified as the L1 distance between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across different attention heads during cache eviction hinder their budget utilization, negatively impacting generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the loss upper bound in theory but also reduces the eviction loss in practice by aligning with the intrinsic patterns of self-attention mechanisms. Integrating this algorithm into two advanced methods, we develop Ada-SnapKV and Ada-Pyramid. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm that they both significantly boost performance across various tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for local model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated from local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge. Yet using long contexts is challenging, as nothing can be generated until the whole context is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause high extra network delays.   CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen uses a custom tensor encoder, leveraging KV cache's distributional properties to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations with negligible decoding overhead, to save bandwidth usage. Second, CacheGen adapts the compression level of different parts of a KV cache to cope with changes in available bandwidth, in order to maintain low context-loading delay and high generation quality. % When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may raise the compression level for a part of the context or recompute its KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on popular LLMs and datasets. Compared to the recent systems that reuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.5-4.3x and the total delay in fetching and processing contexts by 3.2-3.7x with negligible impact on the LLM response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two sequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and generate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent tokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a bottleneck in the generation process. An open question remains whether all prompt tokens are essential for generating the first token. To answer this, we introduce a novel method, LazyLLM, that selectively computes the KV for tokens important for the next token prediction in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Contrary to static pruning approaches that prune the prompt at once, LazyLLM allows language models to dynamically select different subsets of tokens from the context in different generation steps, even though they might be pruned in previous steps. Extensive experiments on standard datasets across various tasks demonstrate that LazyLLM is a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing language models to significantly accelerate the generation without fine-tuning. For instance, in the multi-document question-answering task, LazyLLM accelerates the prefilling stage of the LLama 2 7B model by 2.34x while maintaining accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Microarchitectural timing side channels have been thoroughly investigated as a security threat in hardware designs featuring shared buffers (e.g., caches) or parallelism between attacker and victim task execution. However, contradicting common intuitions, recent activities demonstrate that this threat is real even in microcontroller SoCs without such features. In this paper, we describe SoC-wide timing side channels previously neglected by security analysis and present a new formal method to close this gap. In a case study on the RISC-V Pulpissimo SoC, our method detected a vulnerability to a previously unknown attack variant that allows an attacker to obtain information about a victim's memory access behavior. After implementing a conservative fix, we were able to verify that the SoC is now secure w.r.t. the considered class of timing side channels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm has been widely adopted in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications. However, the efficiency and inference capability of FL is seriously limited due to the presence of stragglers and data imbalance across massive AIoT devices, respectively. To address the above challenges, we present a novel asynchronous FL approach named CaBaFL, which includes a hierarchical Cache-based aggregation mechanism and a feature Balance-guided device selection strategy. CaBaFL maintains multiple intermediate models simultaneously for local training. The hierarchical cache-based aggregation mechanism enables each intermediate model to be trained on multiple devices to align the training time and mitigate the straggler issue. In specific, each intermediate model is stored in a low-level cache for local training and when it is trained by sufficient local devices, it will be stored in a high-level cache for aggregation. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the feature balance-guided device selection strategy in CaBaFL adopts the activation distribution as a metric, which enables each intermediate model to be trained across devices with totally balanced data distributions before aggregation. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art FL methods, CaBaFL achieves up to 9.26X training acceleration and 19.71\% accuracy improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Compute Express Link (CXL) enables support for cache-coherent shared memory among multiple nodes, it also introduces new types of failures--processes can fail before data does, or data might fail before a process does. The lack of a failure model for CXL-based shared memory makes it challenging to understand and mitigate these failures.   To solve these challenges, in this paper, we describe a model categorizing and handling the CXL-based shared memory's failures: data and process failures. Data failures in CXL-based shared memory render data inaccessible or inconsistent for a currently running application. We argue that such failures are unlike data failures in distributed storage systems and require CXL-specific handling. To address this, we look into traditional data failure mitigation techniques like erasure coding and replication and propose new solutions to better handle data failures in CXL-based shared memory systems. Next, we look into process failures and compare the failures and potential solutions with PMEM's failure model and programming solutions. We argue that although PMEM shares some of CXL's characteristics, it does not fully address CXL's volatile nature and low access latencies. Finally, taking inspiration from PMEM programming solutions, we propose techniques to handle these new failures.   Thus, this paper is the first work to define the CXL-based shared memory failure model and propose tailored solutions that address challenges specific to CXL-based systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks our new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. We release our trained weights and training code under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials and their polaritons with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges lies in the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present Free-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on light-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of optical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of a few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate samples that are currently difficult to investigate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of the automotive industry has exacerbated the conflict between the complex traffic environment, increasing communication demands, and limited resources. Given the imperative to mitigate traffic and network congestion, analyzing the performance of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) mesh networks is of great practical significance. Most studies focus solely on individual performance metrics and influencing factors, and the adopted simulation tools, such as OPNET, cannot achieve the dynamic link generation of IoV mesh networks. To address these problems, a network performance analysis model based on actual switches is proposed. First, a typical IoV mesh network architecture is constructed and abstracted into a mathematical model that describes how the link and topology changes over time. Then, the task generation model and the task forwarding model based on actual switches are proposed to obtain the real traffic distribution of the network. Finally, a scientific network performance indicator system is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate that, with rising task traffic and decreasing node caching capacity, the packet loss rate increases, and the task arrival rate decreases in the network. The proposed model can effectively evaluate the network performance across various traffic states and provide valuable insights for network construction and enhancement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrating epitaxial BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) with Si is essential for leveraging its ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical properties in microelectronics. Recently, heterogeneous integration approaches that involve growth of BTO on ideal substrates followed by transfer to a desired substrate show promise of achieving excellent device-quality films. However, beyond simple demonstrations of the existence of ferroelectricity, robust devices with high endurance were not yet demonstrated on Si using the latter approach. Here, using a novel two-step approach to synthesize epitaxial BTO using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on water soluble Sr3Al2O7 (SAO) (on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) substrates), we demonstrate successful integration of high-quality BTO capacitors on Si, with Pr of 7 uC/cm2, Ec 150 kV/cm, ferroelectric and electromechanical endurance of greater than $10^6$ cycles. We further address the challenge of cracking and disintegration of thicker films by first transferring a large area (5 mm x 5 mm) of the templated layer of BTO (~30 nm thick) on the desired substrate, followed by the growth of high-quality BTO on this substrate, as revealed by HRXRD and HRSTEM measurements. These templated Si substrates offer a versatile platform for integrating any epitaxial complex oxides with diverse functionalities onto any inorganic substrate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse tensor decomposition and completion are common in numerous applications, ranging from machine learning to computational quantum chemistry. Typically, the main bottleneck in optimization of these models are contractions of a single large sparse tensor with a network of several dense matrices or tensors (SpTTN). Prior works on high-performance tensor decomposition and completion have focused on performance and scalability optimizations for specific SpTTN kernels. We present algorithms and a runtime system for identifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel. We consider both enumeration of such loop nests for autotuning and efficient algorithms for finding the lowest cost loop-nest for simpler metrics, such as buffer size or cache miss models. Our runtime system identifies the best choice of loop nest without user guidance, and also provides a distributed-memory parallelization of SpTTN kernels. We evaluate our framework using both real-world and synthetic tensors. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms available generalized state-of-the-art libraries and matches the performance of specialized codes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we propose Conceptual Codebook Learning (CoCoLe), a novel fine-tuning method for vision-language models (VLMs) to address the challenge of improving the generalization capability of VLMs while fine-tuning them on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. We recognize that visual concepts, such as textures, shapes, and colors are naturally transferable across domains and play a crucial role in generalization tasks. Motivated by this interesting finding, we learn a conceptual codebook consisting of visual concepts as keys and conceptual prompts as values, which serves as a link between the image encoder's outputs and the text encoder's inputs. Specifically, for a given image, we leverage the codebook to identify the most relevant conceptual prompts associated with the class embeddings to perform the classification. Additionally, we incorporate a handcrafted concept cache as a regularization to alleviate the overfitting issues in low-shot scenarios. We observe that this conceptual codebook learning method is able to achieve enhanced alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CoCoLe method remarkably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation settings, including base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks. Detailed ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of each component in CoCoLe.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> High voltage (~2 kV) AlGaN-channel HEMTs were fabricated with 64% Aluminum composition in the channel. The average on-resistance was ~75 ohm. mm (~21 miliohm. cm^2) for LGD = 20 microns. Breakdown voltage reached >3 kV (tool limit) before passivation however it reduced to ~2 kV after SiN surface passivation and field plates. The apparent high breakdown voltage prior to passivation can possibly be attributed to the field plate effect of the charged trap states of the surface. The breakdown voltage and RON demonstrated a strong linear correlation in a scattered plot with ~50 measured transistors. In pulsed IV measurements with 100 microsecond pulse width and 40 V of off-state bias (tool limit), the dynamic RON increased by ~5% compared to DC RON and current collapse was <10%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on controlling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using an advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic equations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution domain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This force is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number of the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady manner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its time-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are symmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream, both above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator placement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The results indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the cylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift coefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings reveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared to the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the 90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation initiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and applying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow control on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of the second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in downstream flow quality of 20% to 26%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in contexts where computational resources are limited. Traditional attention mechanisms in these models, while powerful, require significant computational and memory resources due to the necessity of recalculating and storing attention weights across different layers. This paper introduces a novel Shared Attention (SA) mechanism, designed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs by directly sharing computed attention weights across multiple layers. Unlike previous methods that focus on sharing intermediate Key-Value (KV) caches, our approach utilizes the isotropic tendencies of attention distributions observed in advanced LLMs post-pretraining to reduce both the computational flops and the size of the KV cache required during inference. We empirically demonstrate that implementing SA across various LLMs results in minimal accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that SA not only conserves computational resources but also maintains robust model performance, thereby facilitating the deployment of more efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization and pruning form the foundation of compression for neural networks, enabling efficient inference for large language models (LLMs). Recently, various quantization and pruning techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in a post-training setting. They rely upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples that are used to generate layer activations. However, no prior work has systematically investigated how the calibration data impacts the effectiveness of model compression methods. In this paper, we present the first extensive empirical study on the effect of calibration data upon LLM performance. We trial a variety of quantization and pruning methods, datasets, tasks, and models. Surprisingly, we find substantial variations in downstream task performance, contrasting existing work that suggests a greater level of robustness to the calibration data. Finally, we make a series of recommendations for the effective use of calibration data in LLM quantization and pruning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Noise bias is a significant source of systematic error in weak gravitational lensing measurements that must be corrected to satisfy the stringent standards of modern imaging surveys in the era of precision cosmology. This paper reviews the analytical noise bias correction method and provides analytical derivations demonstrating that we can recover shear to its second order using the 'renoising' noise bias correction approach introduced by Metacalibration. We implement this analytical noise bias correction within the AnaCal shear estimation framework and propose several enhancements to the noise bias correction algorithm. We evaluate the improved AnaCal using simulations designed to replicate Rubin LSST imaging data. These simulations feature semi-realistic galaxies and stars, complete with representative distributions of magnitudes and Galactic spatial density. We conduct tests under various observational challenges, including cosmic rays, defective CCD columns, bright star saturation, bleed trails, and spatially variable point spread functions. Our results indicate a multiplicative bias in weak lensing shear recovery of less than a few tenths of a percent, meeting LSST DESC requirements without requiring calibration from external image simulations. Additionally, our algorithm achieves rapid processing, handling one galaxy in less than a millisecond.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) has been advancing rapidly in recent times, driven by significant developments in dense passage retrieval and pretrained language models. Current models typically incorporate the FiD framework, which is composed by a neural retriever alongside an encoder-decoder neural reader. In the answer generation process, the retriever will retrieve numerous passages (around 100 for instance), each of which is then individually encoded by the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder makes predictions based on these encoded passages. Nevertheless, this framework can be relatively time-consuming, particularly due to the extensive length of the gathered passages. To address this, we introduce FastFiD in this paper, a novel approach that executes sentence selection on the encoded passages. This aids in retaining valuable sentences while reducing the context length required for generating answers. Experiments on three commonly used datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA and ASQA) demonstrate that our method can enhance the inference speed by 2.3X-5.7X, while simultaneously maintaining the model's performance. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the model's attention reveals that the selected sentences indeed hold a substantial contribution towards the final answer. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/thunlp/FastFiD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding. Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information. Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do? We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts. Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies. Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent attention has focused on the development of methods for post-selection inference. However, the connections between these methods, and the extent to which one might be preferred to another, remain unclear. In this paper, we classify existing methods for post-selection inference into one of two frameworks: infer-and-widen or split-and-condition. The infer-and-widen framework produces confidence intervals whose midpoints are biased due to selection, and must be wide enough to account for this bias. By contrast, split-and-condition directly adjusts the intervals' midpoints to account for selection. We compare the two frameworks in three vignettes: the winner's curse, maximal contrasts, and inference after the lasso. Our results are striking: in each of these examples, a split-and-condition strategy leads to confidence intervals that are much narrower than the state-of-the-art infer-and-widen proposal, when methods are tuned to yield identical selection events. Furthermore, even an ``oracle" infer-and-widen confidence interval -- the narrowest possible interval that could be theoretically attained via infer-and-widen -- is not necessarily narrower than a feasible split-and-condition method. Taken together, these results point to split-and-condition as the most promising framework for post-selection inference in real-world settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have brought autonomous agents closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their promising generalization and emergent capabilities. There is, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-based agents behave, why they could potentially fail, and how to improve them, particularly in demanding real-world planning tasks. In this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we present our study using a realistic benchmark, TravelPlanner, where an agent must meet multiple constraints to generate accurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to address four key research questions: (1) are LLM agents robust enough to lengthy and noisy contexts when it comes to reasoning and planning? (2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact the performance of LLM agents in scenarios with long context? (3) can we rely on refinement to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning LLMs with both positive and negative feedback lead to further improvement? Our comprehensive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs often fail to attend to crucial parts of a long context, despite their ability to handle extensive reference information and few-shot examples; secondly, they still struggle with analyzing the long plans and cannot provide accurate feedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose Feedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which leverages both positive and negative feedback, resulting in substantial gains over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our findings offer in-depth insights to the community on various aspects related to real-world planning applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Limited by the complexity of basis function (B-spline) calculations, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) suffer from restricted parallel computing capability on GPUs. This paper proposes a novel ReLU-KAN implementation that inherits the core idea of KAN. By adopting ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and point-wise multiplication, we simplify the design of KAN's basis function and optimize the computation process for efficient CUDA computing. The proposed ReLU-KAN architecture can be readily implemented on existing deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for both inference and training. Experimental results demonstrate that ReLU-KAN achieves a 20x speedup compared to traditional KAN with 4-layer networks. Furthermore, ReLU-KAN exhibits a more stable training process with superior fitting ability while preserving the "catastrophic forgetting avoidance" property of KAN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we introduce OpenIns3D, a new 3D-input-only framework for 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding. The OpenIns3D framework employs a "Mask-Snap-Lookup" scheme. The "Mask" module learns class-agnostic mask proposals in 3D point clouds, the "Snap" module generates synthetic scene-level images at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract interesting objects, and the "Lookup" module searches through the outcomes of "Snap" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet simple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D open-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance segmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D facilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without requiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it achieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when combined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive capability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand intricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient-physician communication, improve healthcare accessibility, and reduce costs. However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are ultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are born in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These FUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and line excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure line of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks, d203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI forbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV) observed with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and photo-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are C+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI followed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to molecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR OI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV radiation with E > 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective FUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains, implying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization continuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to infer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major depletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud, hinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the outer disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which results in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly solar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Practitioners frequently aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. For instance, in single-cell sequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves over time. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access any cell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems with full individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots, these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimate these dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB, which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest an iterative projection method inspired by Schr\"odinger bridges; we alternate between learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using the learned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the reference class. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulated parametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology, and real motion-capture data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in a wide range of tasks. However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies between high- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we present FuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy the need of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingual capabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, is trained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repository that contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16 programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop two instruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diverse multilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refined with DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensive experiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g., BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretability analyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu is able to learn consistent multilingual representations across different languages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their working mechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu models together with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.

In this work, we introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that provides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and provides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB) that contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and evaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based, metadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based questions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms OpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the hallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack investigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the RAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it generates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in addition to the query.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Capitalizing on the recent availability of ERA5 monthly averaged long-term data records of mean atmospheric and climate fields based on high-resolution reanalysis, deep-learning architectures offer an alternative to physics-based daily numerical weather predictions for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) and annual means. A novel Deep UNet++-based Ensemble (DUNE) neural architecture is introduced, employing multi-encoder-decoder structures with residual blocks. When initialized from a prior month or year, this architecture produced the first AI-based global monthly, seasonal, or annual mean forecast of 2-meter temperatures (T2m) and sea surface temperatures (SST). ERA5 monthly mean data is used as input for T2m over land, SST over oceans, and solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere for each month of 40 years to train the model. Validation forecasts are performed for an additional two years, followed by five years of forecast evaluations to account for natural annual variability. AI-trained inference forecast weights generate forecasts in seconds, enabling ensemble seasonal forecasts. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) statistics are presented globally and over specific regions. These forecasts outperform persistence, climatology, and multiple linear regression for all domains. DUNE forecasts demonstrate comparable statistical accuracy to NOAA's operational monthly and seasonal probabilistic outlook forecasts over the US but at significantly higher resolutions. RMSE and ACC error statistics for other recent AI-based daily forecasts also show superior performance for DUNE-based forecasts. The DUNE model's application to an ensemble data assimilation cycle shows comparable forecast accuracy with a single high-resolution model, potentially eliminating the need for retraining on extrapolated datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In continuous-choice settings, consumers decide not only on whether to purchase a product, but also on how much to purchase. Thus, firms optimize a full price schedule rather than a single price point. This paper provides a methodology to empirically estimate the optimal schedule under multi-dimensional consumer heterogeneity with a focus on B2B applications. We apply our method to novel data from an educational-services firm that contains purchase-size information not only for deals that materialized, but also for potential deals that eventually failed. We show that this data, combined with identifying assumptions, helps infer how price sensitivity varies with "customer size". Using our estimated model, we show that the optimal second-degree price discrimination (i.e., optimal nonlinear tariff) improves the firm's profit upon linear pricing by at least 8.2%. That said, this second-degree price discrimination scheme only recovers 7.1% of the gap between the profitability of linear pricing and that of infeasible first degree price discrimination. We also conduct several further simulation analyses (i) empirically quantifying the magnitude by which incentive-compatibility constraints impact the optimal pricing and profits, (ii) comparing the role of demand- v.s. cost-side factors in shaping the optimal price schedule, and (iii) studying the implications of fixed fees for the optimal contract and profitability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) bring significant challenges to cybersecurity due to their sophisticated and stealthy nature. Traditional cybersecurity measures fail to defend against APTs. Cognitive vulnerabilities can significantly influence attackers' decision-making processes, which presents an opportunity for defenders to exploit. This work introduces PsybORG$^+$, a multi-agent cybersecurity simulation environment designed to model APT behaviors influenced by cognitive vulnerabilities. A classification model is built for cognitive vulnerability inference and a simulator is designed for synthetic data generation. Results show that PsybORG$^+$ can effectively model APT attackers with different loss aversion and confirmation bias levels. The classification model has at least a 0.83 accuracy rate in predicting cognitive vulnerabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the ability of the Euclid telescope to detect galaxy-scale gravitational lenses. To do so, we perform a systematic visual inspection of the $0.7\,\rm{deg}^2$ Euclid ERO data towards the Perseus cluster using both the high-resolution VIS $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ band, and the lower resolution NISP bands. We inspect every extended source brighter than magnitude $23$ in $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ with $41$ expert human classifiers. This amounts to $12\,086$ stamps of $10^{\prime\prime}\,\times\,10^{\prime\prime}$. We find $3$ grade A and $13$ grade B candidates. We assess the validity of these $16$ candidates by modelling them and checking that they are consistent with a single source lensed by a plausible mass distribution. Five of the candidates pass this check, five others are rejected by the modelling and six are inconclusive. Extrapolating from the five successfully modelled candidates, we infer that the full $14\,000\,{\rm deg}^2$ of the Euclid Wide Survey should contain $100\,000^{+70\,000}_{-30\,000}$ galaxy-galaxy lenses that are both discoverable through visual inspection and have valid lens models. This is consistent with theoretical forecasts of $170\,000$ discoverable galaxy-galaxy lenses in Euclid. Our five modelled lenses have Einstein radii in the range $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}68\,<\,\theta_\mathrm{E}\,<1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}24$, but their Einstein radius distribution is on the higher side when compared to theoretical forecasts. This suggests that our methodology is likely missing small Einstein radius systems. Whilst it is implausible to visually inspect the full Euclid data set, our results corroborate the promise that Euclid will ultimately deliver a sample of around $10^5$ galaxy-scale lenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Endogeneity poses significant challenges in causal inference across various research domains. This paper proposes a novel approach to identify and estimate causal effects in the presence of endogeneity. We consider a structural equation with endogenous exposures and an additive error term. Assuming the light-tailedness of the error term, we show that the causal effect can be identified by contrasting extreme conditional quantiles of the outcome given the exposures. Unlike many existing results, our identification approach does not rely on additional parametric assumptions or auxiliary variables. Building on the identification result, we develop an EXtreme-based Causal Effect Learning (EXCEL) method that estimates the causal effect using extreme quantile regression. We establish the consistency of the EXCEL estimator under a general additive structural equation and demonstrate its asymptotic normality in the linear model setting. These results reveal that extreme quantile regression is invulnerable to endogeneity when the error term is light-tailed, which is not appreciated in the literature to our knowledge. The EXCEL method is applied to causal inference problems with invalid instruments to construct a valid confidence set for the causal effect. Simulations and data analysis of an automobile sale dataset show the effectiveness of our method in addressing endogeneity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The field of image synthesis has made tremendous strides forward in the last years. Besides defining the desired output image with text-prompts, an intuitive approach is to additionally use spatial guidance in form of an image, such as a depth map. In state-of-the-art approaches, this guidance is realized by a separate controlling model that controls a pre-trained image generation network, such as a latent diffusion model. Understanding this process from a control system perspective shows that it forms a feedback-control system, where the control module receives a feedback signal from the generation process and sends a corrective signal back. When analysing existing systems, we observe that the feedback signals are timely sparse and have a small number of bits. As a consequence, there can be long delays between newly generated features and the respective corrective signals for these features. It is known that this delay is the most unwanted aspect of any control system. In this work, we take an existing controlling network (ControlNet) and change the communication between the controlling network and the generation process to be of high-frequency and with large-bandwidth. By doing so, we are able to considerably improve the quality of the generated images, as well as the fidelity of the control. Also, the controlling network needs noticeably fewer parameters and hence is about twice as fast during inference and training time. Another benefit of small-sized models is that they help to democratise our field and are likely easier to understand. We call our proposed network ControlNet-XS. When comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches, we outperform them for pixel-level guidance, such as depth, canny-edges, and semantic segmentation, and are on a par for loose keypoint-guidance of human poses. All code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach that significantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51% to 63.91% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46% to 81.88% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53% to 91.13% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the Planck SZiFi catalogues, a new set of 10 catalogues of galaxy clusters detected through their thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signature. The catalogues are produced by applying the SZiFi cluster finder to the Planck PR3 temperature data down to a signal-to-noise threshold of 5. They span three frequency channel combinations (100-857 GHz, 100-545 GHz, and 100-353 GHz) and 7 of them are constructed by spectrally deprojecting the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). This approach allows us, for the first time in the context of cluster finding, to carefully assess the impact of the cluster-correlated CIB on the recovered cluster tSZ observables, which we find to be negligible. In addition, we quantify the impact of the relativistic corrections to the tSZ signal, finding them to be at the 5-10% level for the cluster tSZ amplitude but negligible for the signal-to-noise. We compile our catalogues into a single Planck SZiFi master catalogue containing a total of 1499 detections. We cross-match the master catalogue with several external tSZ and X-ray cluster catalogues, setting a lower bound on the purity of our baseline catalogue of 95% and 99% at a minimum signal-to-noise of 5 and 6, respectively. We validate our cluster detection pipeline by applying it to synthetic observations, recovering cluster number counts for which we are able to produce a theoretical prediction that accurately describes them. This validation exercise indicates that our catalogues are well-suited for cosmological inference. The Planck SZiFi master catalogue will become publicly available at github.com/inigozubeldia/szifi/tree/main/planck_szifi_master_catalogue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML given natural language prompt.   This paper first presents the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user rejected suggestions, as well as analysis of user sentiments. The analysis is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.   To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users in evaluating code assistants for domain-specific languages. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate and we are the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context. We hope this work serves as a reference for software engineering and machine learning researchers exploring code completion services for domain-specific languages in particular and programming languages in general.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capability to generate diverse text is a key challenge facing large language models (LLMs). Thus far, diversity has been studied via metrics such as $n$-gram diversity or diversity of BERT embeddings. However, for these kinds of diversity, the user has little control over the dimensions along which diversity is considered. For example, in the poetry domain, one might desire diversity in terms of rhyme and meter, whereas in the code domain, one might desire diversity in terms of the kinds of expressions used to solve a problem. We propose a diversity metric called structural diversity, where the user provides a mapping from generated text to features capturing the kinds of diversity that they care about. In addition, we propose a novel strategy called chain-of-specification (CoS) prompting for improving diversity by first having the LLM generate a specification encoding one instance of structural features, and then prompting the LLM to generate text that satisfies these features; notably, our strategy works with blackbox LLMs. In our experiments, we show that for structural diversity in the poetry and code domains, CoS significantly improves diversity compared to several baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread adoption and transformative effects of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns regarding their capacity to produce inaccurate and fictitious content, referred to as `hallucinations'. Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as truthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination, and user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improved the detection of hallucination without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task, the agent is required to navigate to a destination following a natural language instruction. While learning-based approaches have been a major solution to the task, they suffer from high training costs and lack of interpretability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for VLN due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing LLM-based methods face limitations in memory construction and diversity of navigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques. Firstly, we introduce a method to maintain a topological map that stores navigation history, retaining information about viewpoints, objects, and their spatial relationships. This map also serves as a global action space. Additionally, we present a Navigation Chain of Thoughts module, leveraging human navigation examples to enrich navigation strategy diversity. Finally, we establish a pipeline that integrates navigational memory and strategies with perception and action prediction modules. Experimental results on the REVERIE and R2R datasets show that our method effectively enhances the navigation ability of the LLM and improves the interpretability of navigation reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, model merging faces two significant challenges: First, existing methods rely heavily on human intuition and customized strategies to tackle multiple tasks. Second, it's difficult to search for the great model merging configuration in limited evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective optimization based model merging method named MM-MO. The proposed method can automatically search merging configurations for multiple tasks with multi-objective optimization algorithms. Moreover, to obtain high-quality model merging configurations within a limited number of evaluation iterations, we have made several improvements to multi-objective Bayesian optimization specifically for model merging scenarios. First, we introduced a weak-to-strong method to improve the acquisition strategy. Second, we employed Fisher information to select configurations, further increasing the chances of discovering superior model merging configurations. Third, we designed a sparsity metric as an additional optimization objective to enhance the model's generalization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms them. Moreover, performance improvements are observed even on the tasks not explicitly targeted as optimization objectives, indicating that our method enhances the overall potential of the model. ...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models with out of distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural enhancement through super-resolution deep neural networks opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. In the presented solutions, two novel techniques are incorporated to make good scheduling decisions for inference overhead optimization and reduce the scheduling latency. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation. The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir reduces the energy overhead of SR-integrated mobile clients by 38.1% at most (and 22.4% on average) and the monetary costs of cloud-based SR by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since 1978, sensors on remote-sensing satellites have provided global, multi-band images at optical wavelengths to assess ocean color. In parallel, sophisticated radiative transfer models account for attenuation and emission by the Earth's atmosphere and ocean, thereby estimating the water-leaving radiance or and remote-sensing reflectance Rrs. From these Rrs measurements, estimates of the absorption and scattering by seawater are inferred. We emphasize an inherent, physical degeneracy in the radiative transfer equation that relates Rrs to the absorption and backscattering coefficients a and b_b, aka inherent optical properties (IOPs). Because Rrs depends solely on the ratio of b_b to a, meaning one cannot retrieve independent functions for the non-water IOPs, a_nw and b_bnw, without a priori knowledge. Moreover, water generally dominates scattering at blue wavelengths and absorption at red wavelengths, further limiting retrievals of IOPs in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that all previous and current multi-spectral satellite observations lack the statistical power to measure more than 3 parameters total to describe a_nw and b_bnw. Due to the ubiquitous exponential-like absorption by color dissolved organic matter at short wavelengths (l<500nm), multi-spectral Rrs do not permit the detection of phytoplankton absorption a_ph without very strict priors. Furthermore, such priors lead to biased and uncertain retrievals of a_ph. Hyperspectral observations may recover a 4th and possibly 5th parameter describing only one or two aspects of the complexity of a_ph. These results cast doubt on decades of literature on IOP retrievals, including estimates of phytoplankton growth and biomass. We further conclude that NASA/PACE will greatly enhance our ability to measure the phytoplankton biomass of Earth, but challenges remain in resolving the IOPs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Med42-v2 introduces a suite of clinical large language models (LLMs) designed to address the limitations of generic models in healthcare settings. These models are built on Llama3 architecture and fine-tuned using specialized clinical data. They underwent multi-stage preference alignment to effectively respond to natural prompts. While generic models are often preference-aligned to avoid answering clinical queries as a precaution, Med42-v2 is specifically trained to overcome this limitation, enabling its use in clinical settings. Med42-v2 models demonstrate superior performance compared to the original Llama3 models in both 8B and 70B parameter configurations and GPT-4 across various medical benchmarks. These LLMs are developed to understand clinical queries, perform reasoning tasks, and provide valuable assistance in clinical environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Minimizing negative impacts of Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems on human societies without human supervision requires them to be able to align with human values. However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Without capturing the biases that may be present, naive calculations of population-level estimates from such maps are statistically invalid. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratification, Olofsson area estimation method, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate statistically valid estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than naively using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with intensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.

Under the ``proportional asymptotic'' regime and Gaussian covariates with known (population) covariance $\Sigma$, we derive Consistent and Asymptotically Normal (CAN) estimators of our targets of inference through a Method-of-Moments type of estimators that bypasses estimation of high dimensional nuisance functions and hyperparameter tuning altogether. Additionally, under non-Gaussian covariates, we demonstrate universality of our results under certain additional assumptions on the regression coefficients and $\Sigma$. We also demonstrate that knowing $\Sigma$ is not essential to our proposed methodology when the sample covariance matrix estimator is invertible. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments and comparisons with existing literature.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation~(LoRA), which updates the dense neural network layers with pluggable low-rank matrices, is one of the best performed parameter efficient fine-tuning paradigms. Furthermore, it has significant advantages in cross-task generalization and privacy-preserving. Hence, LoRA has gained much attention recently, and the number of related literature demonstrates exponential growth. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive overview of the current progress on LoRA. This survey categorizes and reviews the progress from the perspectives of (1) downstream adaptation improving variants that improve LoRA's performance on downstream tasks; (2) cross-task generalization methods that mix multiple LoRA plugins to achieve cross-task generalization; (3) efficiency-improving methods that boost the computation-efficiency of LoRA; (4) data privacy-preserving methods that use LoRA in federated learning; (5) application. Besides, this survey also discusses the future directions in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We apply the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code to the spectro-polarimetric observations obtained by the Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter. This suborbital space experiment measured the variation with wavelength of the four Stokes parameters in the near-ultraviolet spectral region of the Mg II h & k lines over a solar disk area containing part of an active region plage and the edge of a sunspot penumbra. We infer the stratification of the temperature, the electron density, the line of-sight velocity, the micro-turbulent velocity, and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity and circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger temperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions than in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its brightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying moss observed by AIA in the 171 A band, which suggests a similar magnetic origin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this heating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred magnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger electron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions with larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism in the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different to those in the plage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel approach for decision making problems leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods such as expert systems, planning algorithms, and reinforcement learning often exhibit limited generalization, typically requiring the training of new models for each unique task. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate remarkable success in generalizing across varied language tasks, inspiring a new strategy for training decision making models. Our approach, referred to as "Learning then Using" (LTU), entails a two-stage process. Initially, the \textit{learning} phase develops a robust foundational decision making model by integrating diverse knowledge from various domains and decision making contexts. The subsequent \textit{using} phase refines this foundation model for specific decision making scenarios. Distinct from other studies that employ LLMs for decision making through supervised learning, our LTU method embraces a versatile training methodology that combines broad pre-training with targeted fine-tuning. Experiments in e-commerce domains such as advertising and search optimization have shown that LTU approach outperforms traditional supervised learning regimes in decision making capabilities and generalization. The LTU approach is the first practical training architecture for both single-step and multi-step decision making tasks combined with LLMs, which can be applied beyond game and robot domains. It provides a robust and adaptable framework for decision making, enhances the effectiveness and flexibility of various systems in tackling various challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportation and urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems to data-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their "black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. In this paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}. This study evaluates the current state of technological advancements, distinctly outlining the principal challenges and prospective directions for the field. For the convenience of researchers in academia and industry, we provide real-time updates on the latest advances in the field as well as relevant open-source resources via the designated link: https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Awesome-LLM4AD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) represent a significant advancement at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems, offering a continuous-time analog to discrete neural networks. Despite their promise, deploying neural ODEs in practical applications often encounters the challenge of stiffness, a condition where rapid variations in some components of the solution demand prohibitively small time steps for explicit solvers. This work addresses the stiffness issue when employing neural ODEs for model order reduction by introducing a suitable reparametrization in time. The considered map is data-driven and it is induced by the adaptive time-stepping of an implicit solver on a reference solution. We show the map produces a nonstiff system that can be cheaply solved with an explicit time integration scheme. The original, stiff, time dynamic is recovered by means of a map learnt by a neural network that connects the state space to the time reparametrization. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating improvements in efficiency for the neural ODE inference while maintaining robustness and accuracy. The neural network model also showcases good generalization properties for times beyond the training data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional deep Gaussian processes model the data evolution using a discrete hierarchy, whereas differential Gaussian processes (DIFFGPs) represent the evolution as an infinitely deep Gaussian process. However, prior DIFFGP methods often overlook the uncertainty of kernel hyperparameters and assume them to be fixed and time-invariant, failing to leverage the unique synergy between continuous-time models and approximate inference. In this work, we propose a fully Bayesian approach that treats the kernel hyperparameters as random variables and constructs coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to learn their posterior distribution and that of inducing points. By incorporating estimation uncertainty on hyperparameters, our method enhances the model's flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamics. Additionally, our approach provides a time-varying, comprehensive, and realistic posterior approximation through coupling variables using SDE methods. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our method over traditional approaches, showcasing its superior performance in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other metrics. Our work opens up exciting research avenues for advancing Bayesian inference and offers a powerful modeling tool for continuous-time Gaussian processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The concept of the right to be forgotten has led to growing interest in machine unlearning, but reliable validation methods are lacking, creating opportunities for dishonest model providers to mislead data contributors. Traditional invasive methods like backdoor injection are not feasible for legacy data. To address this, we introduce TruVRF, a non-invasive unlearning verification framework operating at class-, volume-, and sample-level granularities. TruVRF includes three Unlearning-Metrics designed to detect different types of dishonest servers: Neglecting, Lazy, and Deceiving. Unlearning-Metric-I checks class alignment, Unlearning-Metric-II verifies sample count, and Unlearning-Metric-III confirms specific sample deletion. Evaluations on three datasets show TruVRF's robust performance, with over 90% accuracy for Metrics I and III, and a 4.8% to 8.2% inference deviation for Metric II. TruVRF also demonstrates generalizability and practicality across various conditions and with state-of-the-art unlearning frameworks like SISA and Amnesiac Unlearning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures have been proposed recently to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD); however, perplexingly, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal. We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We also investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A fundamental challenge of scientific research is inferring causal relations based on observed data. One commonly used approach involves utilizing structural causal models that postulate noisy functional relations among interacting variables. A directed graph naturally represents these models and reflects the underlying causal structure. However, classical identifiability results suggest that, without conducting additional experiments, this causal graph can only be identified up to a Markov equivalence class of indistinguishable models. Recent research has shown that focusing on linear relations with equal error variances can enable the identification of the causal structure from mere observational data. Nonetheless, practitioners are often primarily interested in the effects of specific interventions, rendering the complete identification of the causal structure unnecessary. In this work, we investigate the extent to which less restrictive assumptions of partial homoscedasticity are sufficient for identifying the causal effects of interest. Furthermore, we construct mathematically rigorous confidence regions for total causal effects under structure uncertainty and explore the performance gain of relying on stricter error assumptions in a simulation study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps). Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic. However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp. Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. Finally, HYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns. The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that HYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies. We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835 real-world DApps. The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While modern internet services, such as chatbots, search engines, and online advertising, demand the use of large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), distributed training and inference over heterogeneous computing systems are desired to facilitate these DNN models. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is one the most common strategies to lower the cost of training subject to the overall size of models/data through gating and parallelism in a divide-and-conquer fashion. While DeepSpeed has made efforts in carrying out large-scale MoE training over heterogeneous infrastructures, the efficiency of training and inference could be further improved from several system aspects, including load balancing, communication/computation efficiency, and memory footprint limits. In this work, we present a novel MoESys that boosts efficiency in both large-scale training and inference. Specifically, in the training procedure, the proposed MoESys adopts an Elastic MoE training strategy with 2D prefetch and Fusion communication over Hierarchical storage, so as to enjoy efficient parallelisms. For scalable inference in a single node, especially when the model size is larger than GPU memory, MoESys builds the CPU-GPU memory jointly into a ring of sections to load the model, and executes the computation tasks across the memory sections in a round-robin manner for efficient inference. We carried out extensive experiments to evaluate MoESys, where MoESys successfully trains a Unified Feature Optimization (UFO) model with a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts model of 12B parameters in 8 days on 48 A100 GPU cards. The comparison against the state-of-the-art shows that MoESys outperformed DeepSpeed with 33% higher throughput (tokens per second) in training and 13% higher throughput in inference in general. Particularly, under unbalanced MoE Tasks, e.g., UFO, MoESys achieved 64% higher throughput with 18% lower memory footprints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language model (LLM) inference demands ever-greater resources, there is a rapid growing trend of using low-bit weights to shrink memory usage and boost inference efficiency. However, these low-bit LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), which is a crucial yet under-explored operation that involves multiplying lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Unfortunately, current hardware does not natively support mpGEMM, resulting in indirect and inefficient dequantization-based implementations.   To address the mpGEMM requirements in low-bit LLMs, we explored the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM. However, a conventional LUT implementation falls short of its potential. To fully harness the power of LUT-based mpGEMM, we introduce LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design optimized for low-bit LLM inference. Specifically, we introduce software-based operator fusion and table symmetrization techniques to optimize table precompute and table storage, respectively. Then, LUT Tensor Core proposes the hardware design featuring an elongated tiling shape design to enhance table reuse and a bit-serial design to support various precision combinations in mpGEMM. Moreover, we design an end-to-end compilation stack with new instructions for LUT-based mpGEMM, enabling efficient LLM compilation and optimizations. The evaluation on low-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet, LLAMA) shows that LUT Tensor Core achieves more than a magnitude of improvements on both compute density and energy efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional partial differential equations with constant coefficients often struggle to capture abrupt changes in real-world phenomena, leading to the development of variable coefficient PDEs and Markovian switching models. Recently, research has introduced the concept of PDEs with Markov switching models, established their well-posedness and presented numerical methods. However, there has been limited discussion on parameter estimation for the jump coefficients in these models. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on parameter inference for the wave equation with Markovian switching. We propose a Bayesian statistical framework using discrete sparse Bayesian learning to establish its convergence and a uniform error bound. Our method requires fewer assumptions and enables independent parameter inference for each segment by allowing different underlying structures for the parameter estimation problem within each segmented time interval. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through three numerical cases, which involve noisy spatiotemporal data from different wave equations with Markovian switching. The results show strong performance in parameter estimation for variable coefficient PDEs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort. The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities. However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates. (3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts. In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned. TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration. TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods. In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Point cloud analysis is challenging due to its unique characteristics of unorderness, sparsity and irregularity. Prior works attempt to capture local relationships by convolution operations or attention mechanisms, exploiting geometric information from coordinates implicitly. These methods, however, are insufficient to describe the explicit local geometry, e.g., curvature and orientation. In this paper, we propose On-the-fly Point Feature Representation (OPFR), which captures abundant geometric information explicitly through Curve Feature Generator module. This is inspired by Point Feature Histogram (PFH) from computer vision community. However, the utilization of vanilla PFH encounters great difficulties when applied to large datasets and dense point clouds, as it demands considerable time for feature generation. In contrast, we introduce the Local Reference Constructor module, which approximates the local coordinate systems based on triangle sets. Owing to this, our OPFR only requires extra 1.56ms for inference (65x faster than vanilla PFH) and 0.012M more parameters, and it can serve as a versatile plug-and-play module for various backbones, particularly MLP-based and Transformer-based backbones examined in this study. Additionally, we introduce the novel Hierarchical Sampling module aimed at enhancing the quality of triangle sets, thereby ensuring robustness of the obtained geometric features. Our proposed method improves overall accuracy (OA) on ModelNet40 from 90.7% to 94.5% (+3.8%) for classification, and OA on S3DIS Area-5 from 86.4% to 90.0% (+3.6%) for semantic segmentation, respectively, building upon PointNet++ backbone. When integrated with Point Transformer backbone, we achieve state-of-the-art results on both tasks: 94.8% OA on ModelNet40 and 91.7% OA on S3DIS Area-5.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A major public concern regarding the training of large language models (LLMs) is whether they abusing copyrighted online text. Previous membership inference methods may be misled by similar examples in vast amounts of training data. Additionally, these methods are often too complex for general users to understand and use, making them centralized, lacking transparency, and trustworthiness. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detection} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their own identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{ghost sentences}, a primitive form of unique identifiers, consisting primarily of passphrases made up of random words. By embedding one ghost sentences in a few copyrighted texts, users can detect its membership using a perplexity test and a \textit{user-friendly} last-$k$ words test. The perplexity test is based on the fact that LLMs trained on natural language should exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. As the repetition increases, users can leverage the verbatim memorization ability of LLMs to perform a last-$k$ words test by chatting with LLMs without writing any code. Both tests offer rigorous statistical guarantees for membership inference. For LLaMA-13B, a perplexity test on 30 ghost sentences with an average of 7 repetitions in 148K examples yields a 0.891 ROC AUC. For the last-$k$ words test with OpenLLaMA-3B, 11 out of 16 users, with an average of 24 examples each, successfully identify their data from 1.8M examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Drawing inspiration from animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model for navigation and mapping, rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently using memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex and aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn an environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental structures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during exploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. this is achieved without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of observations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating ambiguous environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detector is capable of generalizing to HOI categories even not encountered during training. Inspired by the impressive zero-shot capabilities offered by CLIP, latest methods strive to leverage CLIP embeddings for improving zero-shot HOI detection. However, these embedding-based methods train the classifier on seen classes only, inevitably resulting in seen-unseen confusion for the model during inference. Besides, we find that using prompt-tuning and adapters further increases the gap between seen and unseen accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we present the first generation-based model using CLIP for zero-shot HOI detection, coined HOIGen. It allows to unlock the potential of CLIP for feature generation instead of feature extraction only. To achieve it, we develop a CLIP-injected feature generator in accordance with the generation of human, object and union features. Then, we extract realistic features of seen samples and mix them with synthetic features together, allowing the model to train seen and unseen classes jointly. To enrich the HOI scores, we construct a generative prototype bank in a pairwise HOI recognition branch, and a multi-knowledge prototype bank in an image-wise HOI recognition branch, respectively. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate our HOIGen achieves superior performance for both seen and unseen classes under various zero-shot settings, compared with other top-performing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has triggered legal and ethical concerns, especially regarding the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in their training datasets. This has led to lawsuits against tech companies accused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given LLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as time-shifts and n-gram overlaps.   This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable training sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent distributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and validate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets for fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma and Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our methods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to those previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our approach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being effective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when bias is removed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are remarkable in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and question answering, but lack the essential perception ability, i.e., object detection. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel research problem of contextual object detection -- understanding visible objects within different human-AI interactive contexts. Three representative scenarios are investigated, including the language cloze test, visual captioning, and question answering. Moreover, we present ContextDET, a unified multimodal model that is capable of end-to-end differentiable modeling of visual-language contexts, so as to locate, identify, and associate visual objects with language inputs for human-AI interaction. Our ContextDET involves three key submodels: (i) a visual encoder for extracting visual representations, (ii) a pre-trained LLM for multimodal context decoding, and (iii) a visual decoder for predicting bounding boxes given contextual object words. The new generate-then-detect framework enables us to detect object words within human vocabulary. Extensive experiments show the advantages of ContextDET on our proposed CODE benchmark, open-vocabulary detection, and referring image segmentation. Github: https://github.com/yuhangzang/ContextDET.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational assistants necessitates dynamic, scalable, and configurable conversational datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Orthogonal group synchronization aims to recover orthogonal group elements from their noisy pairwise measurements. It has found numerous applications including computer vision, imaging science, and community detection. Due to the orthogonal constraints, it is often challenging to find the least squares estimator in presence of noise. In the recent years, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and spectral methods have proven to be powerful tools in recovering the group elements. In particular, under additive Gaussian noise, the SDR exactly produces the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and both MLE and spectral methods are able to achieve near-optimal statistical error. In this work, we take one step further to quantify the uncertainty of the MLE and spectral estimators by considering their distributions. By leveraging the orthogonality constraints in the likelihood function, we obtain a second-order expansion of the MLE and spectral estimator with the leading terms as an anti-symmetric Gaussian random matrix that is on the tangent space of the orthogonal matrix. This also implies state-of-the-art min-max risk bounds as a by-product. Our works provide a general theoretical framework that is potentially useful to find an approximate distribution of the estimators arising from many statistical inference problems with manifold constraints. The numerical experiments confirm our theoretical contribution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current gold standard for evaluating generated chest x-ray (CXR) reports is through radiologist annotations. However, this process can be extremely time-consuming and costly, especially when evaluating large numbers of reports. In this work, we present FineRadScore, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based automated evaluation metric for generated CXR reports. Given a candidate report and a ground-truth report, FineRadScore gives the minimum number of line-by-line corrections required to go from the candidate to the ground-truth report. Additionally, FineRadScore provides an error severity rating with each correction and generates comments explaining why the correction was needed. We demonstrate that FineRadScore's corrections and error severity scores align with radiologist opinions. We also show that, when used to judge the quality of the report as a whole, FineRadScore aligns with radiologists as well as current state-of-the-art automated CXR evaluation metrics. Finally, we analyze FineRadScore's shortcomings to provide suggestions for future improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although In-Context Learning (ICL) brings remarkable performance gains to Large Language Models (LLMs), the improvements remain lower than fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This paper introduces Multi-Modal In-Context Tuning (MMICT), a novel multi-modal fine-tuning paradigm that boosts multi-modal fine-tuning by fully leveraging the promising ICL capability of multi-modal LLMs (MM-LLMs). We propose the Multi-Modal Hub (M-Hub), a unified module that captures various multi-modal features according to different inputs and objectives. Based on M-Hub, MMICT enables MM-LLMs to learn from in-context visual-guided textual features and subsequently generate outputs conditioned on the textual-guided visual features. Moreover, leveraging the flexibility of M-Hub, we design a variety of in-context demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a diverse range of downstream multi-modal tasks demonstrate that MMICT significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning strategy and the vanilla ICT method that directly takes the concatenation of all information from different modalities as input. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/KDEGroup/MMICT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We often infer the state of systems in nature indirectly, for example, in high-energy physics by the interaction of particles with an ambient medium. We adapt this principle to energies $9$ orders of magnitude smaller, to classify the final state of exotic molecules after internal conversion of their electronic state, through their interaction with an ambient quantum fluid, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The BEC is the ground-state of a million bosonic atoms near zero temperature, and a single embedded ultra-long range Rydberg molecule can coherently excite waves in this fluid, which carry telltale signatures of its dynamics. Bond lengths exceeding a micrometer allow us to observe the molecular fingerprint on the BEC in-situ, via optical microscopy. Interpreting images in comparison with simulations strongly suggests that the molecular electronic state rapidly converts from the initially excited S and D orbitals to a much more complex molecular state (called "trilobite''), marked by a maximally localized electron. This internal conversion liberates energy, such that one expects final-state particles to move rapidly through the medium, which is however ruled out by comparing experiment and simulations. The molecule thus must strongly decelerate in the medium, for which we propose a plausible mechanism. Our experiment demonstrates a medium that facilitates and records an electronic state change of embedded exotic molecules in ultra-cold chemistry, with sufficient sensitivity to constrain velocities of final-state particles.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing demand for offline PDF chatbots in automotive industrial production environments, optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in local, low-performance settings has become increasingly important. This study focuses on enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing complex automotive industry documents using locally deployed Ollama models. Based on the Langchain framework, we propose a multi-dimensional optimization approach for Ollama's local RAG implementation. Our method addresses key challenges in automotive document processing, including multi-column layouts and technical specifications. We introduce improvements in PDF processing, retrieval mechanisms, and context compression, tailored to the unique characteristics of automotive industry documents. Additionally, we design custom classes supporting embedding pipelines and an agent supporting self-RAG based on LangGraph best practices. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a proprietary dataset comprising typical automotive industry documents, including technical reports and corporate regulations. We compared our optimized RAG model and self-RAG agent against a naive RAG baseline across three datasets: our automotive industry dataset, QReCC, and CoQA. Results demonstrate significant improvements in context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness, with particularly notable performance on the automotive industry dataset. Our optimization scheme provides an effective solution for deploying local RAG systems in the automotive sector, addressing the specific needs of PDF chatbots in industrial production environments. This research has important implications for advancing information processing and intelligent production in the automotive industry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents results from Kepler photometric light curves and high-resolution spectroscopic study of a super Li-rich giant KIC11087027. Using the light curve analysis, we measured the star's rotational period P$_{\rm rot}$=30.4$\pm$0.1~days, which translates to rotational velocity V$_{\rm rot}$=19.5 $\pm$ 1.7~km s$^{-1}$. Star's location in the HR-diagram, derived values of $^{12}C/^{13}C$ = 7$\pm$1 and $[C/N]=-0.95\pm 0.2$, and the inferred asteroseismic parameters from secondary calibration based on spectra suggest star is a low-mass red clump giant in the He-core burning phase. Using Gaia data, we found evidence of variation in radial velocity and proper motion, indicative of presence of an unresolved binary. The large V$_{\rm rot}$ is probably a result of tidal synchronization combined with the after-effects of He-flash, in which the size of the star is reduced significantly. The simultaneous presence of features like high rotation, very high Li abundance, strong dust shell, and strong flares in a single star is relatively uncommon, suggesting that the star experiencing tidal synchronization has recently undergone He-flash. The results pose a question whether the binary interaction, hence the high rotation, is a prerequisite for dredging-up of the high amounts of Li from the interior to the photosphere during or immediately after the He-flash event.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system typically separates speech into content, speaker, and prosody features using individual encoders. This paper explores how to adapt such a system when a new speech attribute, for example, emotion, needs to be preserved to a greater extent. While existing systems are good at anonymizing speaker embeddings, they are not designed to preserve emotion. Two strategies for this are examined. First, we show that integrating emotion embeddings from a pre-trained emotion encoder can help preserve emotional cues, even though this approach slightly compromises privacy protection. Alternatively, we propose an emotion compensation strategy as a post-processing step applied to anonymized speaker embeddings. This conceals the original speaker's identity and reintroduces the emotional traits lost during speaker embedding anonymization. Specifically, we model the emotion attribute using support vector machines to learn separate boundaries for each emotion. During inference, the original speaker embedding is processed in two ways: one, by an emotion indicator to predict emotion and select the emotion-matched SVM accurately; and two, by a speaker anonymizer to conceal speaker characteristics. The anonymized speaker embedding is then modified along the corresponding SVM boundary towards an enhanced emotional direction to save the emotional cues. The proposed strategies are also expected to be useful for adapting a general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system to preserve other target paralinguistic attributes, with potential for a range of downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generation problems over various domains including images, videos, text, and audio. A practical bottleneck of diffusion models is their sampling speed, due to the repeated evaluation of score estimation networks during the inference. In this work, we propose a novel framework capable of adaptively allocating compute required for the score estimation, thereby reducing the overall sampling time of diffusion models. We observe that the amount of computation required for the score estimation may vary along the time step for which the score is estimated. Based on this observation, we propose an early-exiting scheme, where we skip the subset of parameters in the score estimation network during the inference, based on a time-dependent exit schedule. Using the diffusion models for image synthesis, we show that our method could significantly improve the sampling throughput of the diffusion models without compromising image quality. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various types of solvers for faster sampling, capitalizing on their compatibility to enhance overall efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency. Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Within the domain of person re-identification (ReID), partial ReID methods are considered mainstream, aiming to measure feature distances through comparisons of body parts between samples. However, in practice, previous methods often lack sufficient awareness of anatomical aspect of body parts, resulting in the failure to capture features of the same body parts across different samples. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Part Aware Transformer (PAFormer)}, a pose estimation based ReID model which can perform precise part-to-part comparison. In order to inject part awareness to pose tokens, we introduce learnable parameters called `pose token' which estimate the correlation between each body part and partial regions of the image. Notably, at inference phase, PAFormer operates without additional modules related to body part localization, which is commonly used in previous ReID methodologies leveraging pose estimation models. Additionally, leveraging the enhanced awareness of body parts, PAFormer suggests the use of a learning-based visibility predictor to estimate the degree of occlusion for each body part. Also, we introduce a teacher forcing technique using ground truth visibility scores which enables PAFormer to be trained only with visible parts. A set of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on well-known ReID benchmark datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In long context scenarios, large language models (LLMs) face three main challenges: higher computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias. Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for domain-specific Agents that can cater to the unique needs of enterprises and organizations. Unlike general models, which strive for broad coverage, these specialized Agents rely on focused datasets tailored to their intended applications. This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. By ingesting domain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextually appropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset for fine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation or web-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably, our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates or modifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the need for complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specialized domains where comprehensive datasets are scarce. As a case study, we apply this approach to the domain of psychiatry, a field requiring specialized knowledge and sensitive handling of patient information. The resulting fine-tuned LLM demonstrates showcases the viability of the proposed approach and underscores its potential for widespread adoption across various industries and domains where tailored, accurate, and contextually relevant language models are indispensable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video localization tasks aim to temporally locate specific instances in videos, including temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED) and audio-visual event localization (AVEL). Existing methods over-specialize on each task, overlooking the fact that these instances often occur in the same video to form the complete video content. In this work, we present UniAV, a Unified Audio-Visual perception network, to achieve joint learning of TAL, SED and AVEL tasks for the first time. UniAV can leverage diverse data available in task-specific datasets, allowing the model to learn and share mutually beneficial knowledge across tasks and modalities. To tackle the challenges posed by substantial variations in datasets (size/domain/duration) and distinct task characteristics, we propose to uniformly encode visual and audio modalities of all videos to derive generic representations, while also designing task-specific experts to capture unique knowledge for each task. Besides, we develop a unified language-aware classifier by utilizing a pre-trained text encoder, enabling the model to flexibly detect various types of instances and previously unseen ones by simply changing prompts during inference. UniAV outperforms its single-task counterparts by a large margin with fewer parameters, achieving on-par or superior performances compared to state-of-the-art task-specific methods across ActivityNet 1.3, DESED and UnAV-100 benchmarks.

Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pitch is a foundational aspect of our perception of audio signals. Pitch contours are commonly used to analyze speech and music signals and as input features for many audio tasks, including music transcription, singing voice synthesis, and prosody editing. In this paper, we describe a set of techniques for improving the accuracy of widely-used neural pitch and periodicity estimators to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both speech and music. We also introduce a novel entropy-based method for extracting periodicity and per-frame voiced-unvoiced classifications from statistical inference-based pitch estimators (e.g., neural networks), and show how to train a neural pitch estimator to simultaneously handle both speech and music data (i.e., cross-domain estimation) without performance degradation. Our estimator implementations run 11.2x faster than real-time on a Intel i9-9820X 10-core 3.30 GHz CPU$\unicode{x2014}$approaching the speed of state-of-the-art DSP-based pitch estimators$\unicode{x2014}$or 408x faster than real-time on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. We release all of our code and models as Pitch-Estimating Neural Networks (penn), an open-source, pip-installable Python module for training, evaluating, and performing inference with pitch- and periodicity-estimating neural networks. The code for penn is available at https://github.com/interactiveaudiolab/penn.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sound plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and immersiveness in Augmented Reality (AR). However, current platforms lack support for AR sound authoring due to limited interaction types, challenges in collecting and specifying context information, and difficulty in acquiring matching sound assets. We present SonifyAR, an LLM-based AR sound authoring system that generates context-aware sound effects for AR experiences. SonifyAR expands the current design space of AR sound and implements a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) pipeline to automatically collect contextual information of AR events, including virtual content semantics and real world context. This context information is then processed by a large language model to acquire sound effects with Recommendation, Retrieval, Generation, and Transfer methods. To evaluate the usability and performance of our system, we conducted a user study with eight participants and created five example applications, including an AR-based science experiment, an improving case for AR headset safety, and an assisting example for low vision AR users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the world with the sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper, we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of \emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer, but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The application of AI-powered tools has piqued the interest of many fields, particularly in the academic community. This study uses ChatGPT, currently the most powerful and popular AI tool, as a representative example to analyze how the Chinese public perceives the potential of large language models (LLMs) for educational and general purposes. Although facing accessibility challenges, we found that the number of discussions on ChatGPT per month is 16 times that of Ernie Bot developed by Baidu, the most popular alternative product to ChatGPT in the mainland, making ChatGPT a more suitable subject for our analysis. The study also serves as the first effort to investigate the changes in public opinion as AI technologies become more advanced and intelligent. The analysis reveals that, upon first encounters with advanced AI that was not yet highly capable, some social media users believed that AI advancements would benefit education and society, while others feared that advanced AI, like ChatGPT, would make humans feel inferior and lead to problems such as cheating and a decline in moral principles. The majority of users remained neutral. Interestingly, with the rapid development and improvement of AI capabilities, public attitudes have tended to shift in a positive direction. We present a thorough analysis of the trending shift and a roadmap to ensure the ethical application of ChatGPT-like models in education and beyond.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is derived from a comprehensive analysis of patents across various domains, offering a framework and practical tools for problem-solving. Despite its potential to foster innovative solutions, the complexity and abstractness of TRIZ methodology often make its acquisition and application challenging. This often requires users to have a deep understanding of the theory, as well as substantial practical experience and knowledge across various disciplines. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address these challenges by leveraging their extensive knowledge bases and reasoning capabilities for innovative solution generation within TRIZ-based problem-solving process. This study explores and evaluates the application of LLMs within the TRIZ-based problem-solving process. The construction of TRIZ case collections establishes a solid empirical foundation for our experiments and offers valuable resources to the TRIZ community. A specifically designed workflow, utilizing step-by-step reasoning and evaluation-validated prompt strategies, effectively transforms concrete problems into TRIZ problems and finally generates inventive solutions. Finally, we present a case study in mechanical engineering field that highlights the practical application of this LLM-augmented method. It showcases GPT-4's ability to generate solutions that closely resonate with original solutions and suggests more implementation mechanisms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to The Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.

Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM development.   Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).

When performing inference, speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model to generate speculative tokens and then uses the target LLM to verify those draft tokens. The speedup provided by speculative decoding heavily depends on the choice of the draft model. In this work, we perform a detailed study comprising over 350 experiments with LLaMA-65B and OPT-66B using speculative decoding and delineate the factors that affect the performance gain provided by speculative decoding. Our experiments indicate that the performance of speculative decoding depends heavily on the latency of the draft model, and the draft model's capability in language modeling does not correlate strongly with its performance in speculative decoding. Based on these insights we explore a new design space for draft models and design hardware-efficient draft models for speculative decoding. Our newly designed draft model for LLaMA-65B can provide 111% higher throughput than existing draft models and can generalize further to the LLaMA-2 model family and supervised fine-tuned models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most existing methods often rely on complex models to predict scene depth with high accuracy, resulting in slow inference that is not conducive to deployment. To better balance precision and speed, we first designed SmallDepth based on sparsity. Second, to enhance the feature representation ability of SmallDepth during training under the condition of equal complexity during inference, we propose an equivalent transformation module(ETM). Third, to improve the ability of each layer in the case of a fixed SmallDepth to perceive different context information and improve the robustness of SmallDepth to the left-right direction and illumination changes, we propose pyramid loss. Fourth, to further improve the accuracy of SmallDepth, we utilized the proposed function approximation loss (APX) to transfer knowledge in the pretrained HQDecv2, obtained by optimizing the previous HQDec to address grid artifacts in some regions, to SmallDepth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each proposed component improves the precision of SmallDepth without changing the complexity of SmallDepth during inference, and the developed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI at an inference speed of more than 500 frames per second and with approximately 2 M parameters. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/fwucas/FA-Depth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Workshop courses designed to foster creativity are gaining popularity. However, even experienced faculty teams find it challenging to realize a holistic evaluation that accommodates diverse perspectives. Adequate deliberation is essential to integrate varied assessments, but faculty often lack the time for such exchanges. Deriving an average score without discussion undermines the purpose of a holistic evaluation. Therefore, this paper explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a facilitator to integrate diverse faculty assessments. Scenario-based experiments were conducted to determine if the LLM could integrate diverse evaluations and explain the underlying pedagogical theories to faculty. The results were noteworthy, showing that the LLM can effectively facilitate faculty discussions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated the capability to create evaluation criteria by generalizing a single scenario-based experiment, leveraging its already acquired pedagogical domain knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The debut of chatGPT and BARD has popularized instruction following text generation using LLMs, where a user can interrogate an LLM using natural language requests and obtain natural language answers that matches their requests. Training LLMs to respond in this manner requires a large number of worked out examples of user requests (aka prompts) with corresponding gold responses. In this paper, we introduce two methods for creating such prompts for Arabic cheaply and quickly. The first methods entails automatically translating existing prompt datasets from English, such as PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions, and then using machine translation quality estimation to retain high quality translations only. The second method involves creating natural language prompts on top of existing Arabic NLP datasets. Using these two methods we were able to create more than 67.4 million Arabic prompts that cover a variety of tasks including summarization, headline generation, grammar checking, open/closed question answering, creative writing, etc. We show that fine tuning an open 7 billion parameter large language model, namely base Qwen2 7B, enables it to outperform a state-of-the-art 70 billion parameter instruction tuned model, namely Llama3 70B, in handling Arabic prompts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization and pruning form the foundation of compression for neural networks, enabling efficient inference for large language models (LLMs). Recently, various quantization and pruning techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in a post-training setting. They rely upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples that are used to generate layer activations. However, no prior work has systematically investigated how the calibration data impacts the effectiveness of model compression methods. In this paper, we present the first extensive empirical study on the effect of calibration data upon LLM performance. We trial a variety of quantization and pruning methods, datasets, tasks, and models. Surprisingly, we find substantial variations in downstream task performance, contrasting existing work that suggests a greater level of robustness to the calibration data. Finally, we make a series of recommendations for the effective use of calibration data in LLM quantization and pruning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding. Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information. Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do? We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts. Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies. Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The internet of things (IoT) and other emerging ubiquitous technologies are supporting the rapid spread of smart systems, which has underlined the need for safe, open, and decentralized data storage solutions. With its inherent decentralization and immutability, blockchain offers itself as a potential solution for these requirements. However, the practicality of incorporating blockchain into real-time sensor data storage systems is a topic that demands in-depth examination. While blockchain promises unmatched data security and auditability, some intrinsic qualities, namely scalability restrictions, transactional delays, and escalating storage demands, impede its seamless deployment in high-frequency, voluminous data contexts typical of real-time sensors. This essay launches a methodical investigation into these difficulties, illuminating their underlying causes, potential effects, and potential countermeasures. In addition, we present a novel pragmatic experimental setup and analysis of blockchain for smart system applications, with an extended discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of deploying blockchain based solutions for smart system ecosystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have brought autonomous agents closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their promising generalization and emergent capabilities. There is, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-based agents behave, why they could potentially fail, and how to improve them, particularly in demanding real-world planning tasks. In this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we present our study using a realistic benchmark, TravelPlanner, where an agent must meet multiple constraints to generate accurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to address four key research questions: (1) are LLM agents robust enough to lengthy and noisy contexts when it comes to reasoning and planning? (2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact the performance of LLM agents in scenarios with long context? (3) can we rely on refinement to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning LLMs with both positive and negative feedback lead to further improvement? Our comprehensive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs often fail to attend to crucial parts of a long context, despite their ability to handle extensive reference information and few-shot examples; secondly, they still struggle with analyzing the long plans and cannot provide accurate feedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose Feedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which leverages both positive and negative feedback, resulting in substantial gains over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our findings offer in-depth insights to the community on various aspects related to real-world planning applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing and computer vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this architecture in the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla transformers do not fully exploit the structure of the robot learning problem. Therefore, we propose Body Transformer (BoT), an architecture that leverages the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias that guides the learning process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors and actuators, and rely on masked attention to pool information throughout the architecture. The resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the classical multilayer perceptron, in terms of task completion, scaling properties, and computational efficiency when representing either imitation or reinforcement learning policies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Control-flow attestation (CFA) unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many others. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing use of deep learning across various domains highlights the importance of understanding the decision-making processes of these black-box models. Recent research focusing on the decision boundaries of deep classifiers, relies on generated synthetic instances in areas of low confidence, uncovering samples that challenge both models and humans. We propose a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of deep binary classifiers by selecting representative samples from the decision boundary - prototypes - and applying post-model explanation algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through 2D visualizations and GradientSHAP analysis. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method, revealing distinct and compact clusters and diverse prototypes that capture essential features that lead to low-confidence decisions. By offering a more aggregated view of deep classifiers' decision boundaries, our work contributes to the responsible development and deployment of reliable machine learning systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we introduce OpenIns3D, a new 3D-input-only framework for 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding. The OpenIns3D framework employs a "Mask-Snap-Lookup" scheme. The "Mask" module learns class-agnostic mask proposals in 3D point clouds, the "Snap" module generates synthetic scene-level images at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract interesting objects, and the "Lookup" module searches through the outcomes of "Snap" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet simple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D open-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance segmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D facilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without requiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it achieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when combined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive capability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand intricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms offer great potential for personalizing treatment for participants in clinical trials. However, deploying an online, autonomous algorithm in the high-stakes healthcare setting makes quality control and data quality especially difficult to achieve. This paper proposes algorithm fidelity as a critical requirement for deploying online RL algorithms in clinical trials. It emphasizes the responsibility of the algorithm to (1) safeguard participants and (2) preserve the scientific utility of the data for post-trial analyses. We also present a framework for pre-deployment planning and real-time monitoring to help algorithm developers and clinical researchers ensure algorithm fidelity. To illustrate our framework's practical application, we present real-world examples from the Oralytics clinical trial. Since Spring 2023, this trial successfully deployed an autonomous, online RL algorithm to personalize behavioral interventions for participants at risk for dental disease.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient-physician communication, improve healthcare accessibility, and reduce costs. However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, generating significant interest in their application to recommendation systems. However, existing methods have not fully capitalized on the potential of LLMs, often constrained by limited input information or failing to fully utilize their advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce EXP3RT, a novel LLM-based recommender designed to leverage rich preference information contained in user and item reviews. EXP3RT is basically fine-tuned through distillation from a teacher LLM to perform three key tasks in order: EXP3RT first extracts and encapsulates essential subjective preferences from raw reviews, aggregates and summarizes them according to specific criteria to create user and item profiles. It then generates detailed step-by-step reasoning followed by predicted rating, i.e., reasoning-enhanced rating prediction, by considering both subjective and objective information from user/item profiles and item descriptions. This personalized preference reasoning from EXP3RT enhances rating prediction accuracy and also provides faithful and reasonable explanations for recommendation. Extensive experiments show that EXP3RT outperforms existing methods on both rating prediction and candidate item reranking for top-k recommendation, while significantly enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in a wide range of tasks. However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies between high- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we present FuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy the need of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingual capabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, is trained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repository that contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16 programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop two instruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diverse multilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refined with DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensive experiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g., BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretability analyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu is able to learn consistent multilingual representations across different languages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their working mechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu models together with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the constantly evolving field of cybersecurity, it is imperative for analysts to stay abreast of the latest attack trends and pertinent information that aids in the investigation and attribution of cyber-attacks. In this work, we introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that provides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and provides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB) that contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and attribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and evaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based, metadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based questions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms OpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the hallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack investigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the RAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it generates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in addition to the query.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Predicting the minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) of chips stands as a crucial technique in enhancing the speed and reliability of manufacturing testing flow. However, existing $V_{min}$ prediction methods often overlook various sources of variations in both training and deployment phases. Notably, the neglect of wafer zone-to-zone (intra-wafer) variations and wafer-to-wafer (inter-wafer) variations, compounded by process variations, diminishes the accuracy, data efficiency, and reliability of $V_{min}$ predictors. To address this gap, we introduce a novel data-efficient $V_{min}$ prediction flow, termed restricted bias alignment (RBA), which incorporates a novel variation alignment technique. Our approach concurrently estimates inter- and intra-wafer variations. Furthermore, we propose utilizing class probe data to model inter-wafer variations for the first time. We empirically demonstrate RBA's effectiveness and data efficiency on an industrial 16nm automotive chip dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent and unremitting capability advances have been accompanied by calls for comprehensive, rather than patchwork, regulation of frontier artificial intelligence (AI). Approval regulation is emerging as a promising candidate. An approval regulation scheme is one in which a firm cannot legally market, or in some cases develop, a product without explicit approval from a regulator on the basis of experiments performed upon the product that demonstrate its safety. This approach is used successfully by the FDA and FAA. Further, its application to frontier AI has been publicly supported by many prominent stakeholders. This report proposes an approval regulation schematic for only the largest AI projects in which scrutiny begins before training and continues through to post-deployment monitoring. The centerpieces of the schematic are two major approval gates, the first requiring approval for large-scale training and the second for deployment. Five main challenges make implementation difficult: noncompliance through unsanctioned deployment, specification of deployment readiness requirements, reliable model experimentation, filtering out safe models before the process, and minimizing regulatory overhead. This report makes a number of crucial recommendations to increase the feasibility of approval regulation, some of which must be followed urgently if such a regime is to succeed in the near future. Further recommendations, produced by this report's analysis, may improve the effectiveness of any regulatory regime for frontier AI.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI has revolutionized modern machine learning by providing unprecedented realism, diversity, and efficiency in data generation. This technology holds immense potential for biometrics, including for securing sensitive and personally identifiable information. Given the irrevocability of biometric samples and mounting privacy concerns, biometric template security and secure matching are among the most sought-after features of modern biometric systems. This paper proposes a novel obfuscation method using Generative AI to enhance biometric template security. Our approach utilizes synthetic facial images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as "random chaff points" within a secure vault system. Our method creates n sub-templates from the original template, each obfuscated with m GAN chaff points. During verification, s closest vectors to the biometric query are retrieved from each vault and combined to generate hash values, which are then compared with the stored hash value. Thus, our method safeguards user identities during the training and deployment phases by employing the GAN-generated synthetic images. Our protocol was tested using the AT&T, GT, and LFW face datasets, achieving ROC areas under the curve of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain high accuracy and reasonable computational complexity comparable to those unprotected template methods while significantly enhancing security and privacy, underscoring the potential of Generative AI in developing proactive defensive strategies for biometric systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach that significantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51% to 63.91% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46% to 81.88% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53% to 91.13% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML given natural language prompt.   This paper first presents the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user rejected suggestions, as well as analysis of user sentiments. The analysis is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.   To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users in evaluating code assistants for domain-specific languages. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate and we are the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context. We hope this work serves as a reference for software engineering and machine learning researchers exploring code completion services for domain-specific languages in particular and programming languages in general.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The capability to generate diverse text is a key challenge facing large language models (LLMs). Thus far, diversity has been studied via metrics such as $n$-gram diversity or diversity of BERT embeddings. However, for these kinds of diversity, the user has little control over the dimensions along which diversity is considered. For example, in the poetry domain, one might desire diversity in terms of rhyme and meter, whereas in the code domain, one might desire diversity in terms of the kinds of expressions used to solve a problem. We propose a diversity metric called structural diversity, where the user provides a mapping from generated text to features capturing the kinds of diversity that they care about. In addition, we propose a novel strategy called chain-of-specification (CoS) prompting for improving diversity by first having the LLM generate a specification encoding one instance of structural features, and then prompting the LLM to generate text that satisfies these features; notably, our strategy works with blackbox LLMs. In our experiments, we show that for structural diversity in the poetry and code domains, CoS significantly improves diversity compared to several baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread adoption and transformative effects of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns regarding their capacity to produce inaccurate and fictitious content, referred to as `hallucinations'. Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as truthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination, and user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improved the detection of hallucination without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task, the agent is required to navigate to a destination following a natural language instruction. While learning-based approaches have been a major solution to the task, they suffer from high training costs and lack of interpretability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for VLN due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing LLM-based methods face limitations in memory construction and diversity of navigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques. Firstly, we introduce a method to maintain a topological map that stores navigation history, retaining information about viewpoints, objects, and their spatial relationships. This map also serves as a global action space. Additionally, we present a Navigation Chain of Thoughts module, leveraging human navigation examples to enrich navigation strategy diversity. Finally, we establish a pipeline that integrates navigational memory and strategies with perception and action prediction modules. Experimental results on the REVERIE and R2R datasets show that our method effectively enhances the navigation ability of the LLM and improves the interpretability of navigation reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, model merging faces two significant challenges: First, existing methods rely heavily on human intuition and customized strategies to tackle multiple tasks. Second, it's difficult to search for the great model merging configuration in limited evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective optimization based model merging method named MM-MO. The proposed method can automatically search merging configurations for multiple tasks with multi-objective optimization algorithms. Moreover, to obtain high-quality model merging configurations within a limited number of evaluation iterations, we have made several improvements to multi-objective Bayesian optimization specifically for model merging scenarios. First, we introduced a weak-to-strong method to improve the acquisition strategy. Second, we employed Fisher information to select configurations, further increasing the chances of discovering superior model merging configurations. Third, we designed a sparsity metric as an additional optimization objective to enhance the model's generalization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms them. Moreover, performance improvements are observed even on the tasks not explicitly targeted as optimization objectives, indicating that our method enhances the overall potential of the model. ...

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models with out of distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural enhancement through super-resolution deep neural networks opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. In the presented solutions, two novel techniques are incorporated to make good scheduling decisions for inference overhead optimization and reduce the scheduling latency. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation. The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir reduces the energy overhead of SR-integrated mobile clients by 38.1% at most (and 22.4% on average) and the monetary costs of cloud-based SR by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average).

However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging 5G/6G use cases span various industries, necessitating flexible solutions that leverage emerging technologies to meet diverse and stringent application requirements under changing network conditions. The standard 5G RAN solution, retransmission, reduces packet loss but can increase transmission delay in the process. Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) offers an alternative by proactively sending combinations of original packets, thus reducing both delay and packet loss. Current research often only simulates the integration of RLNC in 5G while we implement and evaluate our approach on real commercially available hardware in a real-world deployment.   We introduce Flexible Network Coding (FlexNC), which enables the flexible fusion of several RLNC protocols by incorporating a forwarder with multiple RLNC nodes. Network operators can configure FlexNC based on network conditions and application requirements. To further boost network programmability, our Recoder in the Network (RecNet) leverages intermediate network nodes to join the coding process. Both the proposed algorithms have been implemented on OpenAirInterface and extensively tested with traffic from different applications in a real network. While FlexNC adapts to various application needs of latency and packet loss, RecNet significantly minimizes packet loss for a remote user with minimal increase in delay compared to pure RLNC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation~(LoRA), which updates the dense neural network layers with pluggable low-rank matrices, is one of the best performed parameter efficient fine-tuning paradigms. Furthermore, it has significant advantages in cross-task generalization and privacy-preserving. Hence, LoRA has gained much attention recently, and the number of related literature demonstrates exponential growth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel approach for decision making problems leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods such as expert systems, planning algorithms, and reinforcement learning often exhibit limited generalization, typically requiring the training of new models for each unique task. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate remarkable success in generalizing across varied language tasks, inspiring a new strategy for training decision making models. Our approach, referred to as "Learning then Using" (LTU), entails a two-stage process. Initially, the \textit{learning} phase develops a robust foundational decision making model by integrating diverse knowledge from various domains and decision making contexts. The subsequent \textit{using} phase refines this foundation model for specific decision making scenarios. Distinct from other studies that employ LLMs for decision making through supervised learning, our LTU method embraces a versatile training methodology that combines broad pre-training with targeted fine-tuning. Experiments in e-commerce domains such as advertising and search optimization have shown that LTU approach outperforms traditional supervised learning regimes in decision making capabilities and generalization. The LTU approach is the first practical training architecture for both single-step and multi-step decision making tasks combined with LLMs, which can be applied beyond game and robot domains. It provides a robust and adaptable framework for decision making, enhances the effectiveness and flexibility of various systems in tackling various challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportation and urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems to data-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their "black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. In this paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}. This study evaluates the current state of technological advancements, distinctly outlining the principal challenges and prospective directions for the field. For the convenience of researchers in academia and industry, we provide real-time updates on the latest advances in the field as well as relevant open-source resources via the designated link: https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Awesome-LLM4AD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society. A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web. Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection. However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions). Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps). Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic. However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp. Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. Finally, HYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns. The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that HYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies. We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835 real-world DApps. The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language model (LLM) inference demands ever-greater resources, there is a rapid growing trend of using low-bit weights to shrink memory usage and boost inference efficiency. However, these low-bit LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), which is a crucial yet under-explored operation that involves multiplying lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Unfortunately, current hardware does not natively support mpGEMM, resulting in indirect and inefficient dequantization-based implementations.   To address the mpGEMM requirements in low-bit LLMs, we explored the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM. However, a conventional LUT implementation falls short of its potential. To fully harness the power of LUT-based mpGEMM, we introduce LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design optimized for low-bit LLM inference. Specifically, we introduce software-based operator fusion and table symmetrization techniques to optimize table precompute and table storage, respectively. Then, LUT Tensor Core proposes the hardware design featuring an elongated tiling shape design to enhance table reuse and a bit-serial design to support various precision combinations in mpGEMM. Moreover, we design an end-to-end compilation stack with new instructions for LUT-based mpGEMM, enabling efficient LLM compilation and optimizations. The evaluation on low-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet, LLAMA) shows that LUT Tensor Core achieves more than a magnitude of improvements on both compute density and energy efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort. The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities. However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates. (3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts. In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned. TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration. TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods. In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A major public concern regarding the training of large language models (LLMs) is whether they abusing copyrighted online text. Previous membership inference methods may be misled by similar examples in vast amounts of training data. Additionally, these methods are often too complex for general users to understand and use, making them centralized, lacking transparency, and trustworthiness. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detection} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their own identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{ghost sentences}, a primitive form of unique identifiers, consisting primarily of passphrases made up of random words. By embedding one ghost sentences in a few copyrighted texts, users can detect its membership using a perplexity test and a \textit{user-friendly} last-$k$ words test. The perplexity test is based on the fact that LLMs trained on natural language should exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. As the repetition increases, users can leverage the verbatim memorization ability of LLMs to perform a last-$k$ words test by chatting with LLMs without writing any code. Both tests offer rigorous statistical guarantees for membership inference. For LLaMA-13B, a perplexity test on 30 ghost sentences with an average of 7 repetitions in 148K examples yields a 0.891 ROC AUC. For the last-$k$ words test with OpenLLaMA-3B, 11 out of 16 users, with an average of 24 examples each, successfully identify their data from 1.8M examples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scarcity and complexity of voxel-level annotations in 3D medical imaging present significant challenges, particularly due to the domain gap between labeled datasets from well-resourced centers and unlabeled datasets from less-resourced centers. This disparity affects the fairness of artificial intelligence algorithms in healthcare. We introduce Diffuse-UDA, a novel method leveraging diffusion models to tackle Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in medical image segmentation. Diffuse-UDA generates high-quality image-mask pairs with target domain characteristics and various structures, thereby enhancing UDA tasks. Initially, pseudo labels for target domain samples are generated. Subsequently, a specially tailored diffusion model, incorporating deformable augmentations, is trained on image-label or image-pseudo-label pairs from both domains. Finally, source domain labels guide the diffusion model to generate image-label pairs for the target domain. Comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that Diffuse-UDA outperforms leading UDA and semi-supervised strategies, achieving performance close to or even surpassing the theoretical upper bound of models trained directly on target domain data. Diffuse-UDA offers a pathway to advance the development and deployment of AI systems in medical imaging, addressing disparities between healthcare environments. This approach enables the exploration of innovative AI-driven diagnostic tools, improves outcomes, saves time, and reduces human error.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has triggered legal and ethical concerns, especially regarding the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in their training datasets. This has led to lawsuits against tech companies accused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given LLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as time-shifts and n-gram overlaps.   This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable training sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent distributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and validate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets for fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma and Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our methods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to those previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our approach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being effective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when bias is removed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are remarkable in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and question answering, but lack the essential perception ability, i.e., object detection. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel research problem of contextual object detection -- understanding visible objects within different human-AI interactive contexts. Three representative scenarios are investigated, including the language cloze test, visual captioning, and question answering. Moreover, we present ContextDET, a unified multimodal model that is capable of end-to-end differentiable modeling of visual-language contexts, so as to locate, identify, and associate visual objects with language inputs for human-AI interaction. Our ContextDET involves three key submodels: (i) a visual encoder for extracting visual representations, (ii) a pre-trained LLM for multimodal context decoding, and (iii) a visual decoder for predicting bounding boxes given contextual object words. The new generate-then-detect framework enables us to detect object words within human vocabulary. Extensive experiments show the advantages of ContextDET on our proposed CODE benchmark, open-vocabulary detection, and referring image segmentation. Github: https://github.com/yuhangzang/ContextDET.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The groundbreaking performance of transformers in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks has led to their replacement of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), owing to the efficiency and accuracy achieved through the self-attention mechanism. This success has inspired researchers to explore the use of transformers in computer vision tasks to attain enhanced long-term semantic awareness. Vision transformers (ViTs) have excelled in various computer vision tasks due to their superior ability to capture long-distance dependencies using the self-attention mechanism. Contemporary ViTs like Data Efficient Transformers (DeiT) can effectively learn both global semantic information and local texture information from images, achieving performance comparable to traditional CNNs. However, their impressive performance comes with a high computational cost due to very large number of parameters, hindering their deployment on devices with limited resources like smartphones, cameras, drones etc. Additionally, ViTs require a large amount of data for training to achieve performance comparable to benchmark CNN models. Therefore, we identified two key challenges in deploying ViTs on smaller form factor devices: the high computational requirements of large models and the need for extensive training data. As a solution to these challenges, we propose compressing large ViT models using Knowledge Distillation (KD), which is implemented data-free to circumvent limitations related to data availability. Additionally, we conducted experiments on object detection within the same environment in addition to classification tasks. Based on our analysis, we found that datafree knowledge distillation is an effective method to overcome both issues, enabling the deployment of ViTs on less resourceconstrained devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational assistants necessitates dynamic, scalable, and configurable conversational datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current gold standard for evaluating generated chest x-ray (CXR) reports is through radiologist annotations. However, this process can be extremely time-consuming and costly, especially when evaluating large numbers of reports. In this work, we present FineRadScore, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based automated evaluation metric for generated CXR reports. Given a candidate report and a ground-truth report, FineRadScore gives the minimum number of line-by-line corrections required to go from the candidate to the ground-truth report. Additionally, FineRadScore provides an error severity rating with each correction and generates comments explaining why the correction was needed. We demonstrate that FineRadScore's corrections and error severity scores align with radiologist opinions. We also show that, when used to judge the quality of the report as a whole, FineRadScore aligns with radiologists as well as current state-of-the-art automated CXR evaluation metrics. Finally, we analyze FineRadScore's shortcomings to provide suggestions for future improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although In-Context Learning (ICL) brings remarkable performance gains to Large Language Models (LLMs), the improvements remain lower than fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This paper introduces Multi-Modal In-Context Tuning (MMICT), a novel multi-modal fine-tuning paradigm that boosts multi-modal fine-tuning by fully leveraging the promising ICL capability of multi-modal LLMs (MM-LLMs). We propose the Multi-Modal Hub (M-Hub), a unified module that captures various multi-modal features according to different inputs and objectives. Based on M-Hub, MMICT enables MM-LLMs to learn from in-context visual-guided textual features and subsequently generate outputs conditioned on the textual-guided visual features. Moreover, leveraging the flexibility of M-Hub, we design a variety of in-context demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a diverse range of downstream multi-modal tasks demonstrate that MMICT significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning strategy and the vanilla ICT method that directly takes the concatenation of all information from different modalities as input. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/KDEGroup/MMICT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the growing demand for offline PDF chatbots in automotive industrial production environments, optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in local, low-performance settings has become increasingly important. This study focuses on enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing complex automotive industry documents using locally deployed Ollama models. Based on the Langchain framework, we propose a multi-dimensional optimization approach for Ollama's local RAG implementation. Our method addresses key challenges in automotive document processing, including multi-column layouts and technical specifications. We introduce improvements in PDF processing, retrieval mechanisms, and context compression, tailored to the unique characteristics of automotive industry documents. Additionally, we design custom classes supporting embedding pipelines and an agent supporting self-RAG based on LangGraph best practices. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a proprietary dataset comprising typical automotive industry documents, including technical reports and corporate regulations. We compared our optimized RAG model and self-RAG agent against a naive RAG baseline across three datasets: our automotive industry dataset, QReCC, and CoQA. Results demonstrate significant improvements in context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness, with particularly notable performance on the automotive industry dataset. Our optimization scheme provides an effective solution for deploying local RAG systems in the automotive sector, addressing the specific needs of PDF chatbots in industrial production environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large machine-learning training datasets can be distilled into small collections of informative synthetic data samples. These synthetic sets support efficient model learning and reduce the communication cost of data sharing. Thus, high-fidelity distilled data can support the efficient deployment of machine learning applications in distributed network environments. A naive way to construct a synthetic set in a distributed environment is to allow each client to perform local data distillation and to merge local distillations at a central server. However, the quality of the resulting set is impaired by heterogeneity in the distributions of the local data held by clients. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the first collaborative data distillation technique, called CollabDM, which captures the global distribution of the data and requires only a single round of communication between client and server. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art one-shot learning method on skewed data in distributed learning environments. We also show the promising practical benefits of our method when applied to attack detection in 5G networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency. Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.   To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.   We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In long context scenarios, large language models (LLMs) face three main challenges: higher computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias. Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid development of large language models in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for domain-specific Agents that can cater to the unique needs of enterprises and organizations. Unlike general models, which strive for broad coverage, these specialized Agents rely on focused datasets tailored to their intended applications. This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. By ingesting domain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextually appropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset for fine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation or web-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably, our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates or modifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the need for complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specialized domains where comprehensive datasets are scarce. As a case study, we apply this approach to the domain of psychiatry, a field requiring specialized knowledge and sensitive handling of patient information. The resulting fine-tuned LLM demonstrates showcases the viability of the proposed approach and underscores its potential for widespread adoption across various industries and domains where tailored, accurate, and contextually relevant language models are indispensable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sound plays a crucial role in enhancing user experience and immersiveness in Augmented Reality (AR). However, current platforms lack support for AR sound authoring due to limited interaction types, challenges in collecting and specifying context information, and difficulty in acquiring matching sound assets. We present SonifyAR, an LLM-based AR sound authoring system that generates context-aware sound effects for AR experiences. SonifyAR expands the current design space of AR sound and implements a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) pipeline to automatically collect contextual information of AR events, including virtual content semantics and real world context. This context information is then processed by a large language model to acquire sound effects with Recommendation, Retrieval, Generation, and Transfer methods. To evaluate the usability and performance of our system, we conducted a user study with eight participants and created five example applications, including an AR-based science experiment, an improving case for AR headset safety, and an assisting example for low vision AR users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the world with the sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper, we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of \emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer, but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The application of AI-powered tools has piqued the interest of many fields, particularly in the academic community. This study uses ChatGPT, currently the most powerful and popular AI tool, as a representative example to analyze how the Chinese public perceives the potential of large language models (LLMs) for educational and general purposes. Although facing accessibility challenges, we found that the number of discussions on ChatGPT per month is 16 times that of Ernie Bot developed by Baidu, the most popular alternative product to ChatGPT in the mainland, making ChatGPT a more suitable subject for our analysis. The study also serves as the first effort to investigate the changes in public opinion as AI technologies become more advanced and intelligent. The analysis reveals that, upon first encounters with advanced AI that was not yet highly capable, some social media users believed that AI advancements would benefit education and society, while others feared that advanced AI, like ChatGPT, would make humans feel inferior and lead to problems such as cheating and a decline in moral principles. The majority of users remained neutral. Interestingly, with the rapid development and improvement of AI capabilities, public attitudes have tended to shift in a positive direction. We present a thorough analysis of the trending shift and a roadmap to ensure the ethical application of ChatGPT-like models in education and beyond.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is derived from a comprehensive analysis of patents across various domains, offering a framework and practical tools for problem-solving. Despite its potential to foster innovative solutions, the complexity and abstractness of TRIZ methodology often make its acquisition and application challenging. This often requires users to have a deep understanding of the theory, as well as substantial practical experience and knowledge across various disciplines. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address these challenges by leveraging their extensive knowledge bases and reasoning capabilities for innovative solution generation within TRIZ-based problem-solving process. This study explores and evaluates the application of LLMs within the TRIZ-based problem-solving process. The construction of TRIZ case collections establishes a solid empirical foundation for our experiments and offers valuable resources to the TRIZ community. A specifically designed workflow, utilizing step-by-step reasoning and evaluation-validated prompt strategies, effectively transforms concrete problems into TRIZ problems and finally generates inventive solutions. Finally, we present a case study in mechanical engineering field that highlights the practical application of this LLM-augmented method. It showcases GPT-4's ability to generate solutions that closely resonate with original solutions and suggests more implementation mechanisms.

Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM development.   Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative Decoding is a widely used technique to speed up inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing quality. When performing inference, speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model to generate speculative tokens and then uses the target LLM to verify those draft tokens. The speedup provided by speculative decoding heavily depends on the choice of the draft model. In this work, we perform a detailed study comprising over 350 experiments with LLaMA-65B and OPT-66B using speculative decoding and delineate the factors that affect the performance gain provided by speculative decoding. Our experiments indicate that the performance of speculative decoding depends heavily on the latency of the draft model, and the draft model's capability in language modeling does not correlate strongly with its performance in speculative decoding. Based on these insights we explore a new design space for draft models and design hardware-efficient draft models for speculative decoding. Our newly designed draft model for LLaMA-65B can provide 111% higher throughput than existing draft models and can generalize further to the LLaMA-2 model family and supervised fine-tuned models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Most existing methods often rely on complex models to predict scene depth with high accuracy, resulting in slow inference that is not conducive to deployment. To better balance precision and speed, we first designed SmallDepth based on sparsity. Second, to enhance the feature representation ability of SmallDepth during training under the condition of equal complexity during inference, we propose an equivalent transformation module(ETM). Third, to improve the ability of each layer in the case of a fixed SmallDepth to perceive different context information and improve the robustness of SmallDepth to the left-right direction and illumination changes, we propose pyramid loss. Fourth, to further improve the accuracy of SmallDepth, we utilized the proposed function approximation loss (APX) to transfer knowledge in the pretrained HQDecv2, obtained by optimizing the previous HQDec to address grid artifacts in some regions, to SmallDepth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each proposed component improves the precision of SmallDepth without changing the complexity of SmallDepth during inference, and the developed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on KITTI at an inference speed of more than 500 frames per second and with approximately 2 M parameters. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/fwucas/FA-Depth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Workshop courses designed to foster creativity are gaining popularity. However, even experienced faculty teams find it challenging to realize a holistic evaluation that accommodates diverse perspectives. Adequate deliberation is essential to integrate varied assessments, but faculty often lack the time for such exchanges. Deriving an average score without discussion undermines the purpose of a holistic evaluation. Therefore, this paper explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a facilitator to integrate diverse faculty assessments. Scenario-based experiments were conducted to determine if the LLM could integrate diverse evaluations and explain the underlying pedagogical theories to faculty. The results were noteworthy, showing that the LLM can effectively facilitate faculty discussions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated the capability to create evaluation criteria by generalizing a single scenario-based experiment, leveraging its already acquired pedagogical domain knowledge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The debut of chatGPT and BARD has popularized instruction following text generation using LLMs, where a user can interrogate an LLM using natural language requests and obtain natural language answers that matches their requests. Training LLMs to respond in this manner requires a large number of worked out examples of user requests (aka prompts) with corresponding gold responses. In this paper, we introduce two methods for creating such prompts for Arabic cheaply and quickly. The first methods entails automatically translating existing prompt datasets from English, such as PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions, and then using machine translation quality estimation to retain high quality translations only. The second method involves creating natural language prompts on top of existing Arabic NLP datasets. Using these two methods we were able to create more than 67.4 million Arabic prompts that cover a variety of tasks including summarization, headline generation, grammar checking, open/closed question answering, creative writing, etc. We show that fine tuning an open 7 billion parameter large language model, namely base Qwen2 7B, enables it to outperform a state-of-the-art 70 billion parameter instruction tuned model, namely Llama3 70B, in handling Arabic prompts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many disciplines of science and engineering deal with problems related to compositions, ranging from chemical compositions in materials science to portfolio compositions in economics. They exist in non-Euclidean simplex spaces, causing many standard tools to be incorrect or inefficient, which is significant in combinatorically or structurally challenging spaces exemplified by Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) and Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). Here, we explore them conceptually in terms of problem spaces and quantitatively in terms of computational feasibility.   This work implements several essential methods specific to the compositional (simplex) spaces through a high-performance open-source library nimplex. Most significantly, we derive and implement an algorithm for constructing a novel n-dimensional simplex graph data structure, which contains all discretized compositions and all possible neighbor-to-neighbor transitions as pointer arrays. Critically, no distance or neighborhood calculations are performed, instead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally generated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\mathcal{O}(N)$, so that graphs with billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to express path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while keeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of existing high-performance gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other path optimization algorithms.

However, we show that AMMs do not enjoy these gains since their operations are not parallelizable.   We present SAMM, an AMM comprising multiple independent shards. All shards operate in the same chain, but they allow for parallel execution as each is independent. The challenge is that traders are incentivized to split each trade among all AMMs in existing designs, leading to lower throughput. SAMM addresses this issue with a novel design of the trading fees. Traders are incentivized to use only a single smallest shard. We show that all Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE) fit the desired behavior: Liquidity providers balance the liquidity among all shards, so the system converges to the state where trades are evenly distributed, overcoming destabilization attacks.   Evaluation in the Sui and Solana blockchains shows that SAMM improves throughput by 5 and by 16, respectively, approaching their limit. SAMM is directly deployable, allowing trading at scale for individuals and DeFi applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks but often fail to handle queries that exceed their knowledge and capabilities, leading to incorrect or fabricated responses. This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the required skills surpassing their capabilities. We first systematically conceptualize infeasible tasks for LLMs, providing formal definitions and categorizations that cover a spectrum of related hallucinations. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to test multiple LLMs' abilities on task feasibility. Furthermore, we explore the potential of training enhancements to increase LLMs' refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods, offering promising directions for refining the operational boundaries of LLMs in real applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating accurate step-by-step reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems and enhance robustness and interpretability. Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP). The analysis reveals interesting findings about different factors contributing to reasoning, including the reward-guidance, breadth-vs-depth in search, world model, and prompt formats, etc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Traditional biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) models, designed for specific tasks or modalities, often exhibit limited flexibility in real-world deployment and struggle to utilize holistic information. Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the complexity of modern systems increases, so does the importance of assessing their security posture through effective vulnerability management and threat modeling techniques. One powerful tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity professionals is the attack graph, a representation of all potential attack paths within a system that an adversary might exploit to achieve a certain objective. Traditional methods of generating attack graphs involve expert knowledge, manual curation, and computational algorithms that might not cover the entire threat landscape due to the ever-evolving nature of vulnerabilities and exploits. This paper explores the approach of leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to automate the generation of attack graphs by intelligently chaining Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on their preconditions and effects. It also shows how to utilize LLMs to create attack graphs from threat reports.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\times$ and 1.25$\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40). Code is available at https://github.com/hdong920/GRIFFIN.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, there is a concern that they can be misused for malicious purposes, such as fraud or denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for detecting whether the party involved in a conversation is a bot or a human. In this paper, we propose a framework named FLAIR, Finding Large Language Model Authenticity via a Single Inquiry and Response, to detect conversational bots in an online manner. Specifically, we target a single question scenario that can effectively differentiate human users from bots. The questions are divided into two categories: those that are easy for humans but difficult for bots (e.g., counting, substitution, searching, and ASCII art reasoning), and those that are easy for bots but difficult for humans (e.g., memorization and computation). Our approach shows different strengths of these questions in their effectiveness, providing a new way for online service providers to protect themselves against nefarious activities. Our code and question set are available at https://github.com/hongwang600/FLAIR.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Instruction Fine-tuning~(IFT) is a critical phase in building large language models~(LLMs). Previous works mainly focus on the IFT's role in the transfer of behavioral norms and the learning of additional world knowledge. However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IFT remains significantly limited. In this paper, we design a knowledge intervention framework to decouple the potential underlying factors of IFT, thereby enabling individual analysis of different factors. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that attempting to learn additional world knowledge through IFT often struggles to yield positive impacts and can even lead to markedly negative effects. Further, we discover that maintaining internal knowledge consistency before and after IFT is a critical factor for achieving successful IFT. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms of IFT and provide robust support for some very recent and potential future works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software documentation supports a broad set of software maintenance tasks; however, creating and maintaining high-quality, multi-level software documentation can be incredibly time-consuming and therefore many code bases suffer from a lack of adequate documentation. We address this problem through presenting HGEN, a fully automated pipeline that leverages LLMs to transform source code through a series of six stages into a well-organized hierarchy of formatted documents. We evaluate HGEN both quantitatively and qualitatively. First, we use it to generate documentation for three diverse projects, and engage key developers in comparing the quality of the generated documentation against their own previously produced manually-crafted documentation. We then pilot HGEN in nine different industrial projects using diverse datasets provided by each project. We collect feedback from project stakeholders, and analyze it using an inductive approach to identify recurring themes. Results show that HGEN produces artifact hierarchies similar in quality to manually constructed documentation, with much higher coverage of the core concepts than the baseline approach. Stakeholder feedback highlights HGEN's commercial impact potential as a tool for accelerating code comprehension and maintenance tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel in generating grammatically valid SQL in Text-to-SQL parsing, they often struggle to ensure semantic accuracy in queries, leading to user confusion and diminished system usability. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SQLFixAgent, a new consistency-enhanced multi-agent collaborative framework designed for detecting and repairing erroneous SQL. Our framework comprises a core agent, SQLRefiner, alongside two auxiliary agents: SQLReviewer and QueryCrafter. The SQLReviewer agent employs the rubber duck debugging method to identify potential semantic mismatches between SQL and user query. If the error is detected, the QueryCrafter agent generates multiple SQL as candidate repairs using a fine-tuned SQLTool. Subsequently, leveraging similar repair retrieval and failure memory reflection, the SQLRefiner agent selects the most fitting SQL statement from the candidates as the final repair. We evaluated our proposed framework on five Text-to-SQL benchmarks. The experimental results show that our method consistently enhances the performance of the baseline model, specifically achieving an execution accuracy improvement of over 3\% on the Bird benchmark. Our framework also has a higher token efficiency compared to other advanced methods, making it more competitive.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. This challenge has prompted research on enhancing LLM-codebase interaction at a repository scale. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce CodexGraph, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, CodexGraph enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. We assess CodexGraph using three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. Additionally, we develop five real-world coding applications. With a unified graph database schema, CodexGraph demonstrates competitive performance and potential in both academic and real-world environments, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in software engineering.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal reasoning is the primary bottleneck that Large Language Models (LLMs) must overcome to attain human-level intelligence. To address this, we introduce the Causal Chain of Prompting (C2P) as the first reasoning framework that equips current LLMs with causal reasoning capabilities. C2P operates autonomously, avoiding reliance on external tools or modules during both the causal learning and reasoning phases, and can be seamlessly implemented during the training or fine-tuning of LLMs. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in causal learning and subsequent reasoning accuracy of LLMs. We illustrate how C2P enhances LLMs' ability to causally reason in real-world scenarios, addressing complex problems in fields such as healthcare, medicine, economics, education, social sciences, environmental science, and marketing. With few-shot learning, GPT-4 Turbo using C2P with as few as six examples achieves significant performance improvements, boasting over a 33% increase in reasoning accuracy over the most state-of-the-art LLMs, which perform nearly randomly in similar circumstances. This demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating C2P into LLM training or fine-tuning processes, thereby empowering these models with advanced causal reasoning capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Underwater object detection has higher requirements of running speed and deployment efficiency for the detector due to its specific environmental challenges. NMS of two- or one-stage object detectors and transformer architecture of query-based end-to-end object detectors are not conducive to deployment on underwater embedded devices with limited processing power. As for the detrimental effect of underwater color cast noise, recent underwater object detectors make network architecture or training complex, which also hinders their application and deployment on underwater vehicle platforms. In this paper, we propose the Underwater DECO with improved deNoising training (U-DECN), the query-based end-to-end object detector (with ConvNet encoder-decoder architecture) for underwater color cast noise that addresses the above problems. We integrate advanced technologies from DETR variants into DECO and design optimization methods specifically for the ConvNet architecture, including Separate Contrastive DeNoising Forward and Deformable Convolution in SIM. To address the underwater color cast noise issue, we propose an underwater color denoising query to improve the generalization of the model for the biased object feature information by different color cast noise. Our U-DECN, with ResNet-50 backbone, achieves 61.4 AP (50 epochs), 63.3 AP (72 epochs), 64.0 AP (100 epochs) on DUO, and 21 FPS (5 times faster than Deformable DETR and DINO 4 FPS) on NVIDIA AGX Orin by TensorRT FP16, outperforming the other state-of-the-art query-based end-to-end object detectors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models have showcased impressive zero-shot classification capabilities when equipped with suitable text prompts. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of test-time prompt tuning; however, these methods typically require per-image prompt adaptation during inference, which incurs high computational budgets and limits scalability and practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we introduce Self-TPT, a novel framework leveraging Self-supervised learning for efficient Test-time Prompt Tuning. The key aspect of Self-TPT is that it turns to efficient predefined class adaptation via self-supervised learning, thus avoiding computation-heavy per-image adaptation at inference. Self-TPT begins by co-training the self-supervised and the classification task using source data, then applies the self-supervised task exclusively for test-time new class adaptation. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPT) as the key task for self-supervision. CPT is designed to minimize the intra-class distances while enhancing inter-class distinguishability via contrastive learning. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that CPT could closely mimic back-propagated gradients of the classification task, offering a plausible explanation for its effectiveness. Motivated by this finding, we further introduce a gradient matching loss to explicitly enhance the gradient similarity. We evaluated Self-TPT across three challenging zero-shot benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate that Self-TPT not only significantly reduces inference costs but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing the efficiency-efficacy trade-off.

However, writing SQL queries requires specialized knowledge, which poses a challenge for non-professional users trying to access and query databases. Text-to-SQL parsing solves this issue by converting natural language queries into SQL queries, thus making database access more accessible for non-expert users. To take advantage of the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), a range of new methods have emerged, with a primary focus on prompt engineering and fine-tuning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLMs in text-to-SQL tasks, discussing benchmark datasets, prompt engineering, fine-tuning methods, and future research directions. We hope this review will enable readers to gain a broader understanding of the recent advances in this field and offer some insights into its future trajectory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Performing unsupervised domain adaptation on resource-constrained edge devices is a significant task. Although existing research allows edge devices to use subnets with different computational budgets for inference, they often require expensive pre-training and do not consider the issues of parameter precision redundancy in the model, which is not conducive to the deployment of the model on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a ReTraining-Free Quantized (RTF-Q) network based on unsupervised domain adaptation, featuring quantized subnets of varying computational costs that can operate on devices with dynamically changing computation budgets. Our network has three switchable dimensions: width (number of channels), input resolution, and quantization bit-width. Specifically, we choose subnet dimensions that have minimal impact on network performance and then directly load the official weight files without requiring expensive and time-consuming pre-training on Imagenet-1K. To further reduce the network's computational load and memory usage, we use quantization-aware training, reducing the BitOPs of full-precision networks by at least 1/16. We propose a training method called SandwichQ for multiple quantization bit widths, which can efficiently train multiple quantization subnets. By training in multiple quantization bit-width spaces simultaneously and using the proposed SandwichQ rule, we achieve better network performance compared to using a single quantization bit-width alone. Experimental results show that our method achieves classification accuracy comparable to SOTA methods on various UDA tasks, significantly reducing network size and computational overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In response to the urgent demand for grid stability and the complex challenges posed by renewable energy integration and electricity market dynamics, the power sector increasingly seeks innovative technological solutions. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have become a key technology to improve efficiency and promote intelligent progress in the power sector with their excellent natural language processing, logical reasoning, and generalization capabilities. Despite their potential, the absence of a performance evaluation benchmark for LLM in the power sector has limited the effective application of these technologies. Addressing this gap, our study introduces "ElecBench", an evaluation benchmark of LLMs within the power sector. ElecBench aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing evaluation benchmarks by providing comprehensive coverage of sector-specific scenarios, deepening the testing of professional knowledge, and enhancing decision-making precision. The framework categorizes scenarios into general knowledge and professional business, further divided into six core performance metrics: factuality, logicality, stability, security, fairness, and expressiveness, and is subdivided into 24 sub-metrics, offering profound insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLM applications in the power sector. To ensure transparency, we have made the complete test set public, evaluating the performance of eight LLMs across various scenarios and metrics. ElecBench aspires to serve as the standard benchmark for LLM applications in the power sector, supporting continuous updates of scenarios, metrics, and models to drive technological progress and application.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We primarily focus on the field of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, which has been actively explored recently and poses a significant challenge in effectively enhancing recommender systems with logical reasoning abilities and open-world knowledge. Current mainstream efforts mainly center around injecting personalized information from recommendation models into LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between semantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face three significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in existing works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters as the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users' characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong personalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises effectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and inference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable for large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only see a small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the whole datasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address these problems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRA module that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-Short Modality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for different modalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost. Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventional recommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our RecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code generation has been greatly enhanced by the profound advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) recently. Nevertheless, such LLM-based code generation approaches still struggle to generate error-free code in a few tries when faced with complex problems. To address this, the prevailing strategy is to sample a huge number of candidate programs, with the hope of any one in them could work. However, users of code generation systems usually expect to find a correct program by reviewing or testing only a small number of code candidates. Otherwise, the system would be unhelpful. In this paper, we propose Top Pass, a code ranking approach that identifies potential correct solutions from a large number of candidates. Top Pass directly optimizes the pass@k loss function, enhancing the quality at the top of the candidate list. This enables the user to find the correct solution within as few tries as possible. Experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that our Top Pass method enhances the usability of code generation models by producing better ranking results, particularly achieving a 32.9\% relative improvement in pass@1 on CodeContests when compared to the state-of-the-art ranking method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in many different settings has provided various solutions and strategies for networking paradigms. Therefore, it reduces the complexity of the developments for the existing problems, which otherwise require more sophisticated approaches. One of those existing problems is the unknown user locations in an infrastructure-less environment in which users cannot connect to any communication device or computation-providing server, which is essential to task offloading in order to achieve the required quality of service (QoS). Therefore, in this study, we investigate this problem thoroughly and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme, DeepAir. DeepAir considers all of the necessary steps including sensing, localization, resource allocation, and multi-access edge computing (MEC) to achieve QoS requirements for the offloaded tasks without violating the maximum tolerable delay. To this end, we use two types of UAVs including detector UAVs, and serving UAVs. We utilize detector UAVs as DRL agents which ensure sensing, localization, and resource allocation. On the other hand, we utilize serving UAVs to provide MEC features. Our experiments show that DeepAir provides a high task success rate by deploying fewer detector UAVs in the environment, which includes different numbers of users and user attraction points, compared to benchmark methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit great potential for chart question answering (CQA). Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research. Source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/zengxingchen/ChartQA-MLLM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time roots in applying language models for biomedical applications: models are trained on historical data and will be deployed for new or future data, which may vary from training data. While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance, distance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify temporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time matters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of performance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical quantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid benchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence. Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves. We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages. This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level. Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens. Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts. The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens. Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB. Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks. Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. Code is available at: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Parrot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles, ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) deployed on autonomous vehicles has become a significant concern. Driving simulators have emerged as crucial platforms for testing autonomous driving systems, offering realistic, dynamic, and configurable environments. However, existing simulation-based ADS testers have largely overlooked the reliability of the simulators, potentially leading to overlooked violation scenarios and subsequent safety security risks during real-world deployment. In our investigations, we identified that collision detectors in simulators could fail to detect and report collisions in certain collision scenarios, referred to as ignored collision scenarios.   This paper aims to systematically discover ignored collision scenarios to improve the reliability of autonomous driving simulators. To this end, we present ICSFuzz, a black-box fuzzing approach to discover ignored collision scenarios efficiently. Drawing upon the fact that the ignored collision scenarios are a sub-type of collision scenarios, our approach starts with the determined collision scenarios. Following the guidance provided by empirically studied factors contributing to collisions, we selectively mutate arbitrary collision scenarios in a step-wise manner toward the ignored collision scenarios and effectively discover them.   We compare ICSFuzz with DriveFuzz, a state-of-the-art simulation-based ADS testing method, by replacing its oracle with our ignored-collision-aware oracle. The evaluation demonstrates that ICSFuzz outperforms DriveFuzz by finding 10-20x more ignored collision scenarios with a 20-70x speedup. All the discovered ignored collisions have been confirmed by developers with one CVE ID assigned.
