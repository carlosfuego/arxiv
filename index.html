                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> On-disk graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is essential for large-scale, high-dimensional vector retrieval, yet its performance is widely recognized to be limited by the prohibitive I/O costs. Interestingly, we observed that the performance of on-disk graph-based index systems is compute-bound, not I/O-bound, with the rising of the vector data dimensionality (e.g., hundreds or thousands). This insight uncovers a significant optimization opportunity: existing on-disk graph-based index systems universally target I/O reduction and largely overlook computational overhead, which leaves a substantial performance improvement space.   In this work, we propose AlayaLaser, an efficient on-disk graph-based index system for large-scale high-dimensional vector similarity search. In particular, we first conduct performance analysis on existing on-disk graph-based index systems via the adapted roofline model, then we devise a novel on-disk data layout in AlayaLaser to effectively alleviate the compute-bound, which is revealed by the above roofline model analysis, by exploiting SIMD instructions on modern CPUs. We next design a suite of optimization techniques (e.g., degree-based node cache, cluster-based entry point selection, and early dispatch strategy) to further improve the performance of AlayaLaser. We last conduct extensive experimental studies on a wide range of large-scale high-dimensional vector datasets to verify the superiority of AlayaLaser. Specifically, AlayaLaser not only surpasses existing on-disk graph-based index systems but also matches or even exceeds the performance of in-memory index systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their "in-context" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods (e.g., HNSW) have become the de facto state of the art for their high precision and low latency. To scale beyond main memory, recent out-of-memory ANNS systems leverage SSDs to store large vector indexes. However, they still suffer from severe CPU underutilization and read amplification (i.e., storage stalls) caused by limited access locality during graph traversal. We present VeloANN, which mitigates storage stalls through a locality-aware data layout and a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime. VeloANN utilizes hierarchical compression and affinity-based data placement scheme to co-locate related vectors within the same page, effectively reducing fragmentation and over-fetching. We further design a record-level buffer pool, where each record groups the neighbors of a vector; by persistently retaining hot records in memory, it eliminates excessive page swapping under constrained memory budgets. To minimize CPU scheduling overheads during disk I/O interruptions, VeloANN employs a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime for lightweight task scheduling. On top of this, it incorporates asynchronous prefetching and a beam-aware search strategy to prioritize cached data, ultimately improving overall search efficiency. Extensive experiments show that VeloANN outperforms state-of-the-art disk-based ANN systems by up to 5.8x in throughput and 3.25x in latency reduction, while achieving 0.92x the throughput of in-memory systems using only 10% of their memory footprint.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce ARPG, a novel visual Autoregressive model that enables Randomized Parallel Generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image in-painting, out-painting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/argsss/DPCache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Production LLM serving must simultaneously deliver high throughput, low latency, and sufficient context capacity under non-stationary traffic and mixed request requirements. Data parallelism (DP) maximizes throughput by running independent replicas, while tensor parallelism (TP) reduces per-request latency and pools memory for long-context inference. However, existing serving stacks typically commit to a static parallelism configuration at deployment; adapting to bursts, priorities, or long-context requests is often disruptive and slow. We present Flying Serving, a vLLM-based system that enables online DP-TP switching without restarting engine workers. Flying Serving makes reconfiguration practical by virtualizing the state that would otherwise force data movement: (i) a zero-copy Model Weights Manager that exposes TP shard views on demand, (ii) a KV Cache Adaptor that preserves request KV state across DP/TP layouts, (iii) an eagerly initialized Communicator Pool to amortize collective setup, and (iv) a deadlock-free scheduler that coordinates safe transitions under execution skew. Across three popular LLMs and realistic serving scenarios, Flying Serving improves performance by up to $4.79\times$ under high load and $3.47\times$ under low load while supporting latency- and memory-driven requests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient video generation models are increasingly vital for multimedia synthetic content generation. Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.   We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.   Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\times$ without violating SLO.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.   Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.   In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.   Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.   Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Tuning parallel file system in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems remains challenging due to the complex I/O paths, diverse I/O patterns, and dynamic system conditions. While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Due to its scalability and lightweight, we believe CARAT has the potential to be widely deployed into existing PFS and benefit various data-intensive applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models engage in extended reasoning tasks, they accumulate significant state -- architectural mappings, trade-off decisions, codebase conventions -- within the context window. This understanding is lost when sessions reach context limits and undergo lossy compaction. We propose Contextual Memory Virtualisation (CMV), a system that treats accumulated LLM understanding as version-controlled state. Borrowing from operating system virtual memory, CMV models session history as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with formally defined snapshot, branch, and trim primitives that enable context reuse across independent parallel sessions. We introduce a three-pass structurally lossless trimming algorithm that preserves every user message and assistant response verbatim while reducing token counts by a mean of 20% and up to 86% for sessions with significant overhead by stripping mechanical bloat such as raw tool outputs, base64 images, and metadata. A single-user case-study evaluation across 76 real-world coding sessions demonstrates that trimming remains economically viable under prompt caching, with the strongest gains in mixed tool-use sessions, which average 39% reduction and reach break-even within 10 turns. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/CosmoNaught/claude-code-cmv.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method leverages properties of the 3D solid angle to solve the relevant surface integral using a boundary formulation with rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by \textit{memoizing} (i.e. caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based low-delay service framework is proposed for fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The suffix tree is arguably the most fundamental data structure on strings: introduced by Weiner (SWAT 1973) and McCreight (JACM 1976), it allows solving a myriad of computational problems on strings in linear time. Motivated by its large space usage, subsequent research focused first on reducing its size by a constant factor via Suffix Arrays, and later on reaching space proportional to the size of the compressed string. Modern compressed indexes, such as the $r$-index (Gagie et al., SODA 2018), fit in space proportional to $r$, the number of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform (a strong and universal repetitiveness measure). These advances, however, came with a price: while modern compressed indexes boast optimal bounds in the RAM model, they are often orders of magnitude slower than uncompressed counterparts in practice due to catastrophic cache locality. This reality gap highlights that Big-O complexity in the RAM model has become a misleading predictor of real-world performance, leaving a critical question unanswered: can we design compressed indexes that are efficient in the I/O model of computation?   We answer this in the affirmative by introducing a new Suffix Array sampling technique based on particular path decompositions of the suffix tree. We prove that sorting the suffix tree leaves by specific priority functions induces a decomposition where the number of distinct paths (each corresponding to a string suffix) is bounded by $r$. This allows us to solve indexed pattern matching efficiently in the I/O model using a Suffix Array sample of size at most $r$, strictly improving upon the (tight) $2r$ bound of Suffixient Arrays, another recent compressed Suffix Array sampling technique.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have significantly advanced with the advent of large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern large-scale recommendation systems rely heavily on user interaction history sequences to enhance the model performance. The advent of large language models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly transformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently (e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories (10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates significant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in industry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately address these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention (VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to user history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization into a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those tokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system and then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and inference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong user histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and inference costs fixed, which is essential in industry. Our approach achieves significant improvements in offline and online metrics and has been successfully deployed on an industry leading recommendation platform serving billions of users.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs scale, low-bit floating-point formats like MXFP and NVFP4 offer new opportunities for precision and efficiency. In this work, we evaluate HiFloat (HiF8 and HiF4), a family of formats tailored for Ascend NPUs. Through rigorous comparison across weight-activation and KV-cache tasks, we provide three key insights: (1) INT8 suits narrow-range data, while floating-point formats excel with high-variance data; (2) in 4-bit regimes, HiF4's hierarchical scaling prevents the accuracy collapse seen in integer formats; and (3) HiFloat is fully compatible with state-of-the-art post-training quantization frameworks. Overall, HiFloat provides a solution for high-efficiency LLM inference on NPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The scaling of Large Language Model (LLM) services faces significant cost and latency challenges, making effective caching under tight capacity crucial. Existing cache replacement policies, from heuristics to learning-based methods, predominantly rely on limited-window statistics such as recency and frequency. We show these signals are not robust for real-world LLM workloads, which exhibit long reuse distances and sparse local recurrence.   To address these limitations, we propose Relation-Aware Cache (RAC), an online eviction strategy that leverages semantic relations among requests to guide eviction decisions. RAC synthesizes two relation-aware signals: (1) Topical Prevalence, which aggregates access evidence at the topic level to capture long-horizon reuse; and (2) Structural Importance, which leverages local intra-topic dependency structure to discriminate entries by their future reuse value. Extensive evaluations show that RAC maintains high effectiveness across diverse workloads, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 20%--30% in cache hit ratio.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we identify and address the core challenges of agentic memory management in LLM serving, where large-scale storage, frequent updates, and multiple coexisting agents jointly introduce complex and high-cost approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching problems. We present Pancake, a multi-tier agentic memory system that unifies three key techniques: (i) multi-level index caching for single agents, (ii) coordinated index management across multiple agents, and (iii) collaborative GPU-CPU acceleration. Pancake exposes easy-to-use interface that can be integrated into memory-based agents like Mem-GPT, and is compatible with agentic frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. Experiments on realistic agent workloads show that Pancake substantially outperforms existing frameworks, achieving more than 4.29x end-to-end throughput improvement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Altermagnets offer a unique pathway to functional spintronics by combining vanishing magnetization with large spin splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O can deliver giant tunneling magnetoresistance through orientation-dependent spin filtering. By analyzing the crystallographic spin segregation, we show that transport along specific crystallographic axes is nearly fully spin-polarized within the symmetry-protected ballistic channels. We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Symbolic distillation replaces neural networks, or components thereof, with interpretable, closed-form mathematical expressions. This approach has shown promise in discovering physical laws and mathematical relationships directly from trained deep learning models, yet adoption remains limited due to the engineering barrier of integrating symbolic regression into deep learning workflows. We introduce SymTorch, a library that automates this distillation by wrapping neural network components, collecting their input-output behavior, and approximating them with human-readable equations via PySR. SymTorch handles the engineering challenges that have hindered adoption: GPU-CPU data transfer, input-output caching, model serialization, and seamless switching between neural and symbolic forward passes. We demonstrate SymTorch across diverse architectures including GNNs, PINNs and transformer models. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept for accelerating LLM inference by replacing MLP layers with symbolic surrogates, achieving an 8.3\% throughput improvement with moderate performance degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.   This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating multi-frame, action-rich visual narratives without fine-tuning faces a threefold tension: action text faithfulness, subject identity fidelity, and cross-frame background continuity. We propose StoryTailor, a zero-shot pipeline that runs on a single RTX 4090 (24 GB) and produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving image sequences from a long narrative prompt, per-subject references, and grounding boxes. Three synergistic modules drive the system: Gaussian-Centered Attention (GCA) to dynamically focus on each subject core and ease grounding-box overlaps; Action-Boost Singular Value Reweighting (AB-SVR) to amplify action-related directions in the text embedding space; and Selective Forgetting Cache (SFC) that retains transferable background cues, forgets nonessential history, and selectively surfaces retained cues to build cross-scene semantic ties. Compared with baseline methods, experiments show that CLIP-T improves by up to 10-15%, with DreamSim lower than strong baselines, while CLIP-I stays in a visually acceptable, competitive range. With matched resolution and steps on a 24 GB GPU, inference is faster than FluxKontext. Qualitatively, StoryTailor delivers expressive interactions and evolving yet stable scenes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) generalizes the graph Fourier transform (GFT) but suffers from a significant computational bottleneck: determining the optimal transform order requires expensive eigendecomposition and matrix multiplication, leading to $O(N^3)$ complexity. To address this issue, we propose a fast GFRFT (FGFRFT) algorithm for unitary GFT matrices based on Fourier series approximation and an efficient caching strategy. FGFRFT reduces the complexity of generating transform matrices to $O(2LN^2)$ while preserving differentiability, thereby enabling adaptive order learning. We validate the algorithm through theoretical analysis, approximation accuracy tests, and order learning experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical efficacy for image and point cloud denoising and present the fractional specformer, which integrates the FGFRFT into the specformer architecture. This integration enables the model to overcome the limitations of a fixed GFT basis and learn optimal fractional orders for complex data. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates computation and achieves superior performance compared with the GFRFT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of large language model (LLM)-based agents has unlocked new possibilities for autonomous multi-turn reasoning and tool-augmented decision-making. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.

Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.   On alice29 (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context LLMs demand accurate inference at low latency, yet decoding becomes primarily constrained by KV cache as context grows. Prior pruning methods are largely context-agnostic: their token selection ignores step-wise relevance and local semantics, which undermines quality. Moreover, their irregular accesses and selection overheads yield only limited wall-clock speedups. To address this, we propose \textbf{CHESS}, an \textit{algorithm-system co-design} KV-cache management system. Algorithmically, CHESS introduces a context-aware, hierarchical selection policy that dynamically reconstructs a coherent context for the current decoding. System-wise, coarse granularity selection eliminates expensive data movement, fully realizing practical acceleration from theoretical sparsity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CHESS surpasses Full-KV quality using only \textbf{1\%} of the KV cache, delivers low-latency stable inference with up to \textbf{4.56$\times$} higher throughput, and consistently outperforms other strong baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, their trustworthiness has become a critical concern. However, in dependency recommendation scenarios, the reliability of LLMs is undermined by widespread package hallucinations, where models often recommend hallucinated packages. Recent studies have proposed a range of approaches to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, existing approaches typically merely reduce hallucination rates rather than eliminate them, leaving persistent software security risks.   In this work, we argue that package hallucinations are theoretically preventable based on the key insight that package validity is decidable through finite and enumerable authoritative package lists. Building on this, we propose PackMonitor, the first approach capable of fundamentally eliminating package hallucinations by continuously monitoring the model's decoding process and intervening when necessary. To implement this in practice, PackMonitor addresses three key challenges: (1) determining when to trigger intervention via a Context-Aware Parser that continuously monitors model outputs and selectively activates intervening only during installation command generation; (2) resolving how to intervene by employing a Package-Name Intervenor that strictly limits the decoding space to an authoritative package list; and (3) ensuring monitoring efficiency through a DFA-Caching Mechanism that enables scalability to millions of packages with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments on five widely used LLMs demonstrate that PackMonitor is a training-free, plug-and-play solution that consistently reduces package hallucination rates to zero while maintaining low-latency inference and preserving original model capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a new model for ML-augmented online decision making, called online algorithms with unreliable guidance (OAG). This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.   We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We initiate the study of the Careless Coupon Collector's Problem (CCCP), a novel variation of the classical coupon collector, that we envision as a model for information systems such as web crawlers, dynamic caches, and fault-resilient networks. In CCCP, a collector attempts to gather $n$ distinct coupon types by obtaining one coupon type uniformly at random in each discrete round, however the collector is \textit{careless}: at the end of each round, each collected coupon type is independently lost with probability $p$. We analyze the number of rounds required to complete the collection as a function of $n$ and $p$. In particular, we show that it transitions from $Θ(n \ln n)$ when $p = o\big(\frac{\ln n}{n^2}\big)$ up to $Θ\big((\frac{np}{1-p})^n\big)$ when $p=ω\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)$ in multiple distinct phases. Interestingly, when $p=\frac{c}{n}$, the process remains in a metastable phase, where the fraction of collected coupon types is concentrated around $\frac{1}{1+c}$ with probability $1-o(1)$, for a time window of length $e^{Θ(n)}$. Finally, we give an algorithm that computes the expected completion time of CCCP in $O(n^2)$ time.

The device was evaluated under both ambient light and X-ray exposure conditions. Initial characterization under ambient light ensured proper optical focusing; subsequently, camera settings (ISO and exposure time) were evaluated and optimized for X-ray imaging performance. Spatial resolution of the developed device was quantified using the Slanted-Edge method to derive the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The device achieves MTF20 values of 68 lp/mm under ambient light and 25 lp/mm under X-ray irradiation (50 and 70 kV) with Gd2O2S:Tb screen. Besides, the modularity of the developed device was confirmed by conducting the tests with LYSO:Ce and GAGG:Ce screens. Results demonstrate that this compact, cost-effective platform delivers spatial resolution comparable to clinical radiography systems, with potential applications in scientific, educational, and medical contexts where cost and portability are critical factors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-tenant LLM serving frameworks widely adopt shared Key-Value caches to enhance efficiency. However, this creates side-channel vulnerabilities enabling prompt leakage attacks. Prior studies identified these attack surfaces yet focused on expanding attack vectors rather than optimizing attack performance, reporting impractically high attack costs that underestimate the true privacy risk. We propose OptiLeak, a reinforcement learning-enhanced framework that maximizes prompt reconstruction efficiency through two-stage fine-tuning. Our key insight is that domain-specific ``hard tokens'' -- terms difficult to predict yet carrying sensitive information -- can be automatically identified via likelihood ranking and used to construct preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, eliminating manual annotation. This enables effective preference alignment while avoiding the overfitting issues of extended supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on three benchmarks spanning medical and financial domains, OptiLeak achieves up to $12.48\times$ reduction in average requests per token compared to baseline approaches, with consistent improvements across model scales from 3B to 14B parameters. Our findings demonstrate that cache-based prompt leakage poses a more severe threat than previously reported, underscoring the need for robust cache isolation in production deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In long-context large language model (LLM) inference, the prefill stage dominates computation due to self-attention over the complete input context. Sparse attention significantly reduces self-attention computation by limiting each token's interactions to a subset of tokens. The attention sparsity pattern varies across input prompts, and within a prompt, each attention head can follow a distinct pattern. This makes attention sparsity dynamic. The requirement of generating the sparsity pattern, combined with limited data reuse in attention, shifts the prefill compute to being memory-bound. This, in addition to the huge energy requirements for long-context inference on GPU, motivates FPGAs as good candidates for accelerating dynamic long-context inference.   To tackle these challenges, we propose FAST-Prefill, the first FPGA accelerator for long-context prefill-stage inference with dynamic sparse attention. To efficiently generate sparse indices, we propose a \textit{fused pipeline unit with a memory-aware execution order} to reduce large tensors and irregular memory accesses. To reduce off-chip memory traffic for accessing the KV cache, we utilize the memory hierarchy to design a \textit{liveness-driven, dual-tier cache}. For high-throughput matrix multiplication, we design a \textit{hybrid Matrix Processing Unit (MPU)} with DSPs and bit-plane decomposition using LUTs. We implement FAST-Prefill on Alveo U280 and evaluate it on the Llama and Qwen models (batch size = 1) for context lengths ranging from 4K to 128K tokens. We demonstrate an average speedup of up to 2.5$\times$ in TTFT and 4.5$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over GPU implementation on Nvidia A5000 GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation tasks. However, the high computational demands of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) pose a significant challenge to their practical deployment. While feature caching is a promising acceleration strategy, existing methods based on simple reusing or training-free forecasting struggle to adapt to the complex, stage-dependent dynamics of the diffusion process, often resulting in quality degradation and failing to maintain consistency with the standard denoising process. To address this, we propose a LEarnable Stage-Aware (LESA) predictor framework based on two-stage training. Our approach leverages a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to accurately learn temporal feature mappings from data. We further introduce a multi-stage, multi-expert architecture that assigns specialized predictors to different noise-level stages, enabling more precise and robust feature forecasting. Extensive experiments show our method achieves significant acceleration while maintaining high-fidelity generation. Experiments demonstrate 5.00x acceleration on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality degradation (1.0% drop), 6.25x speedup on Qwen-Image with a 20.2% quality improvement over the previous SOTA (TaylorSeer), and 5.00x acceleration on HunyuanVideo with a 24.7% PSNR improvement over TaylorSeer. State-of-the-art performance on both text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis validates the effectiveness and generalization capability of our training-based framework across different models. Our code is included in the supplementary materials and will be released on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI applications increasingly depend on long-context inference, where LLMs consume substantial context to support stronger reasoning. Common examples include retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory layers, and multi-agent orchestration. As input contexts get longer, prefill latency becomes the main bottleneck. Yet today's prefill acceleration techniques face a trade-off: they either preserve reasoning quality but deliver little KV-cache reuse, or improve reuse at the cost of degraded reasoning quality.   We present ContextPilot, a system that accelerates prefill by introducing context reuse as a new mechanism for faster long-context inference. ContextPilot introduces a context index to identify overlapping context blocks across LLM interactions (e.g., across users and turns). It further proposes context ordering and de-duplication techniques to maximize KV-cache reuse. To preserve reasoning quality under reuse, it introduces succinct context annotations that prevent quality degradation. Finally, ContextPilot is built around a modular architecture with a clean interface that integrates with existing inference engines. Extensive evaluation shows that ContextPilot reduces LLM prefill latency by up to $3\times{}$ compared to state-of-the-art methods while preserving reasoning quality. At longer context lengths, it can even improve reasoning quality. ContextPilot is open-sourced at: https://github.com/EfficientContext/ContextPilot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Long-context modeling is essential for symbolic music generation, since motif repetition and developmental variation can span thousands of musical events. However, practical composition and performance workflows frequently rely on resource-limited devices (e.g., electronic instruments and portable computers), making heavy memory and attention computation difficult to deploy. We introduce Depth-Structured Music Recurrence (DSMR), a recurrent long-context Transformer for full-piece symbolic music modeling that extends context beyond fixed-length excerpts via segment-level recurrence with detached cross-segment states, featuring a layer-wise memory-horizon schedule that budgets recurrent KV states across depth. DSMR is trained in a single left-to-right pass over each complete composition, akin to how a musician experiences it from beginning to end, while carrying recurrent cross-segment states forward. Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers. Experiments on the piano performance dataset MAESTRO demonstrate that two-scale DSMR provides a practical quality--efficiency recipe for full-length long-context symbolic music modeling with recurrent attention under limited computational resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Analytical workloads exhibit substantial semantic repetition, yet most production caches key entries by SQL surface form (text or AST), fragmenting reuse across BI tools, notebooks, and NL interfaces. We introduce a safety-first middleware cache for dashboard-style OLAP over star schemas that canonicalizes both SQL and NL into a unified key space -- the OLAP Intent Signature -- capturing measures, grouping levels, filters, and time windows. Reuse requires exact intent matches under strict schema validation and confidence-gated NL acceptance; two correctness-preserving derivations (roll-up, filter-down) extend coverage without approximate matching. Across TPC-DS, SSB, and NYC TLC (1,395 queries), we achieve 82% hit rate versus 28% (text) and 56% (AST) with zero false hits; derivations double hit rate on hierarchical queries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-diameter topologies such as Dragonfly and Slim Fly are increasingly adopted in HPC and datacenter networks, yet existing load balancing techniques either rely on proprietary in-network mechanisms or fail to utilize the full path diversity of these topologies. We introduce Spritz, a flexible sender-based load balancing framework that shifts adaptive topology-aware routing to the endpoints using only standard Ethernet features. We propose two algorithms, Spritz-Scout and Spritz-Spray that, respectively, explore and adaptively cache efficient paths using ECN, packet trimming, and timeout feedback. Through simulation on Dragonfly and Slim Fly topologies with over 1000 endpoints, Spritz outperforms ECMP, UGAL-L, and prior sender-based approaches by up to 1.8x in flow completion time under AI training and datacenter workloads, while offering robust failover with performance improvements of up to 25.4x under link failures, all without additional hardware support. Spritz enables datacenter-scale, commodity Ethernet networks to efficiently leverage low-diameter topologies, offering unified routing and load balancing for the Ultra Ethernet era.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce derivation depth-a computable metric of the reasoning effort needed to answer a query based on a given set of premises. We model information as a two-layered structure linking abstract knowledge with physical carriers, and separate essential core facts from operational shortcuts. For any finite premise base, we define and prove the computability of derivation depth. By encoding reasoning traces and applying information-theoretic incompressibility arguments, we establish fundamental bounds linking depth to the descriptive complexity of queries. For frequently asked, information-rich queries, the minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times the logarithm of the knowledge base size. This leads to a practical storage-computation tradeoff: queries accessed beyond a critical threshold become cheaper to cache than recompute. We formulate optimal cache allocation as a mathematical optimization problem solvable with approximation guarantees and extend the framework to handle noisy or incomplete knowledge bases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates LLM inference by verifying draft tokens in parallel. However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Existing Speculative Decoding strategies typically rely on static speculative lengths, failing to adapt to fluctuating request loads or identify the optimal moment to halt speculation. The cost of restarting speculative inference also remains unquantified. During traffic surges, the marginal utility of speculation diminishes; yet, the draft model's persistent memory footprint competes for available KV cache. This resource contention limits the maximum batch size, thereby degrading overall system throughput. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a resource-aware adaptive speculative framework. It first adjusts to the request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes. Crucially, upon detecting significant request queuing or KV cache shortages, it disables speculative decoding and offloads the draft model to the CPU. This reclaims memory for the KV cache, thereby facilitating larger batch sizes and maximizing overall system throughput. Experiments show that Nightjar achieves up to 27.29% higher throughput and 12.90% lower latency compared to standard speculative decoding under dynamic request arrival rates in real-time LLM serving scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but incur high memory and computation costs. Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personal AI agents incur substantial cost via repeated LLM calls. We show existing caching methods fail: GPTCache achieves 37.9% accuracy on real benchmarks; APC achieves 0-12%. The root cause is optimizing for the wrong property -- cache effectiveness requires key consistency and precision,   not classification accuracy. We observe cache-key evaluation reduces to clustering evaluation and apply V-measure decomposition to separate these on n=8,682 points across MASSIVE, BANKING77, CLINC150, and NyayaBench v2, our new 8,514-entry multilingual agentic dataset (528 intents, 20 W5H2 classes, 63 languages). We introduce W5H2, a structured intent decomposition framework. Using SetFit with 8 examples per class, W5H2 achieves 91.1%+/-1.7% on MASSIVE in ~2ms -- vs 37.9% for   GPTCache and 68.8% for a 20B-parameter LLM at 3,447ms. On NyayaBench v2 (20 classes), SetFit achieves 55.3%, with cross-lingual transfer across 30 languages. Our five-tier cascade handles 85% of interactions locally, projecting 97.5% cost reduction. We provide risk-controlled selective prediction guarantees via RCPS with nine bound families.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Within this family, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) currently perform best but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features, most notably KV caching. We introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, smoothly interpolating between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Unlike prior work, which uses transformers with bidirectional attention as MDM denoisers, we exploit the connection between MDMs and Any-Order autoregressive models and adopt causal attention. This design lets us compute the exact likelihood of MDMs for the first time and, crucially, enables us \to introduce KV caching for MDMs while preserving parallel generation for the first time, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, Eso-LMs achieves a new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto frontier for unconditional generation. On long contexts, it yields $\mathbf{14 - 65{}\times}$ faster inference than standard MDMs and $\mathbf{3 - 4{}\times}$ faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide code, model checkpoints, and a video tutorial on the project page: https://s-sahoo.com/Eso-LMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices such as PCs enables low-latency inference with strong privacy guarantees, but long-context inference is fundamentally constrained by limited memory and compute resources. Beyond model parameters, the KV cache becomes the dominant bottleneck due to its linear growth with context length. Although prior work exploits contextual sparsity to evict unimportant KV data, these approaches are largely designed for memory-rich platforms and incur prohibitive data transfer overhead when applied to resource-constrained edge devices with external storage. In this paper, we propose HillInfer, an importance-aware long-context LLM inference framework on the edge that leverages SmartSSD-assisted hierarchical KV cache management. HillInfer jointly manages KV cache pools across the CPU and SmartSSD, and performs in-storage importance evaluation to reduce unnecessary data movement. Furthermore, we design an adaptive, prefetch-based pipeline that overlaps computation and KV data transfer across GPU, CPU, and SmartSSD, minimizing end-to-end inference latency without sacrificing accuracy. We implement HillInfer on a PC with a commodity GPU, and experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate up to 8.56 $\times$ speedup over baselines while preserving model accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic caches return cached responses for semantically similar prompts to reduce LLM inference latency and cost. They embed cached prompts and store them alongside their response in a vector database. Embedding similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between a request and its nearest neighbor prompt from the cache. Existing systems use the same static similarity threshold across all requests to determine whether two prompts can share similar responses. However, we observe that static thresholds do not give formal correctness guarantees, result in unexpected error rates, and lead to suboptimal cache hit rates. This paper proposes vCache, the first verified semantic cache with user-defined error rate guarantees for predictable performance. It employs an online learning algorithm to estimate an optimal threshold for each cached prompt, enabling reliable cache responses without additional training. Our experiments show that vCache consistently meets the specified error bounds while outperforming state-of-the-art static-threshold and fine-tuned embedding baselines with up to 12.5$\times$ higher cache hit and 26$\times$ lower error rates. We release the vCache implementation and four benchmarks to support future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Streaming video understanding requires models to robustly encode, store, and retrieve information from a continuous video stream to support accurate video question answering (VQA). Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames. Our method, MemStream, achieves +8.0% on CG-Bench, +8.5% on LVBench, and +2.4% on VideoMME (Long) over ReKV with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Backend enrichment is now widely deployed in sensitive domains such as product recommendation pipelines, healthcare, and finance, where models are trained on confidential data and retrieve private features whose values influence inference behavior while remaining hidden from the API caller. This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.   Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.   Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work on test-time scaling for large language model (LLM) reasoning typically assumes that allocating more inference-time computation uniformly improves correctness. However, prior studies show that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized: a small subset of low-confidence tokens disproportionately contributes to reasoning errors and unnecessary output expansion. Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy. Our code will be made available at: https://github.com/bolo-web/CCD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration and presents a proof-of-concept design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a widely adopted backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation, yet their iterative denoising process incurs high computational costs. Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to $5.54\times$ latency reduction across various DiT-based image and video generation models, while incurring negligible quality degradation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g., low-rank approximation or attention pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in convolutional networks, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices (Q, K, V, O) into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7\% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement-trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than GQA, low-rank baselines and recent Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification tasks with 66.7\% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on large pretrained models to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With automated systems increasingly issuing search queries alongside humans, Information Retrieval (IR) faces a major shift. Yet IR remains human-centred, with systems, evaluation metrics, user models, and datasets designed around human queries and behaviours. Consequently, IR operates under assumptions that no longer hold in practice, with changes to workload volumes, predictability, and querying behaviours. This misalignment affects system performance and optimisation: caching may lose effectiveness, query pre-processing may add overhead without improving results, and standard metrics may mismeasure satisfaction. Without adaptation, retrieval models risk satisfying neither humans, nor the emerging user segment of agents. However, datasets capturing agent search behaviour are lacking, which is a critical gap given IR's historical reliance on data-driven evaluation and optimisation. We develop a methodology for collecting all the data produced and consumed by agentic retrieval-augmented systems when answering queries, and we release the Agentic Search Queryset (ASQ) dataset. ASQ contains reasoning-induced queries, retrieved documents, and thoughts for queries in HotpotQA, Researchy Questions, and MS MARCO, for 3 diverse agents and 2 retrieval pipelines. The accompanying toolkit enables ASQ to be extended to new agents, retrievers, and datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs (NS-SwiG), an algorithm for Bayesian inference and evidence estimation in high-dimensional models whose likelihood admits a factorization, such as hierarchical Bayesian models. We construct a procedure to sample from the likelihood-constrained prior using a Slice-within-Gibbs kernel: an outer update of hyperparameters followed by inner block updates over local parameters. A likelihood-budget decomposition caches per-block contributions so that each local update checks feasibility in constant time rather than recomputing the global constraint at linearly growing cost. This reduces the per-replacement cost from quadratic to linear in the number of groups, and the overall algorithmic complexity from cubic to quadratic under standard assumptions. The decomposition extends naturally beyond independent observations, and we demonstrate this on Markov-structured latent variables. We evaluate NS-SwiG on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating scalability to thousands of dimensions and accurate evidence estimates even on posterior geometries where state-of-the-art gradient-based samplers can struggle.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $π$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization: equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescales. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we show that linearly polarized laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization between otherwise identical sublattices in the $d$-wave compensated altermagnet (AM) RuO$_2$, resulting in a \textit{photo-induced ferrimagnetic state} with a strong net magnetization of $\sim$0.2 $μ_B$ per unit cell. The sign and magnitude of this metastable magnetization are highly controllable by laser polarization. We identify polarization-selective asymmetric optical intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) as the primary mechanism generating the net moment, followed by asymmetric spin flips (a-SF) that further amplifies it. Both effects originate from the characteristic nodal spin band topology of \textit{d}-wave AMs. Moreover, we demonstrate that this laser-induced magnetization is universal across various $d$-wave AMs, including experimentally confirmed KV$_2$Se$_2$O and RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. We uncover a robust route to light-controlled magnetization in AMs on ultrafast timescales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In January 2026, torrential rains killed 200-300 people across Southern Africa, exposing a critical reality: 60% of the continent lacks effective early warning systems due to infrastructure costs. Traditional radar stations exceed USD 1 million each, leaving Africa with an 18x coverage deficit compared to the US and EU. We present a production-grade architecture for deploying NVIDIA Earth-2 AI weather models at USD 1,430-1,730/month for national-scale deployment - enabling coverage at 2,000-4,545x lower cost than radar. The system generates 15-day global atmospheric forecasts, cached in PostgreSQL to enable user queries under 200 milliseconds without real-time inference.   Deployed in South Africa in February 2026, our system demonstrates three technical contributions: (1) a ProcessPoolExecutor-based event loop isolation pattern that resolves aiobotocore session lifecycle conflicts in async Python applications; (2) a database-backed serving architecture where the GPU writes global forecasts directly to PostgreSQL, eliminating HTTP transfer bottlenecks for high-resolution tensors; and (3) an automated coordinate management pattern for multi-step inference across 61 timesteps. Forecasts are delivered via WhatsApp, leveraging 80%+ market penetration. This architecture makes continent-scale early warning systems economically viable, supporting UNDRR findings that such systems reduce disaster death rates by 6x. All architectural details are documented inline for full reproducibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> DarkSide-20k (DS-20k) is a next-generation dual-phase liquid argon (LAr) time projection chamber (TPC) devoted to the direct-detection of dark matter. The detector is currently under construction in Hall-C at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of approximately 3500 m water equivalent. The detector will instrument 49.7 t of low-radioactivity underground LAr contained within an acrylic TPC and is designed to reach a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section sensitivity down to $10^{-48}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of $0.1\,\mathrm{TeV}/c^{2}$ in a 200 tonne-year run. In DS-20k a uniform electric drift field is established in the active volume to transport ionization electrons toward the electroluminescence region, with the required high voltage delivered to the TPC cathode through a custom cable and stress-cone assembly. At the University of California, Davis, a dedicated test setup was developed to reproduce the DS-20k cathode high-voltage connection in LAr, matching the local electric-field conditions. This work summarizes the results of a comprehensive test campaign validating the operation of the DS-20k cathode HV system in LAr up to $-100$ kV.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The prefill stage in long-context LLM inference remains a computational bottleneck. Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one. We implement this as Cross-Layer Attention Aggregation (CLAA), which closes the gap to the oracle upper bound and reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 39\% compared to the Full KV Cache baseline.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings, failing to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions. This paper presents Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). This architecture introduces three advances: (1) Symmetric INT8 Scalar Quantization, achieving 3.1x spatial compression and 5.6x math acceleration via NEON SDOT intrinsics; (2) a decoupled Write-Ahead Log (WAL) ensuring crash-recoverability with statistically negligible overhead (<1%); and (3) a Sidecar Blob Arena eliminating the prior 440-character text ceiling via an append-only mmap-backed blob file with generational garbage collection. The Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB) exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-5us retrieval latencies, with INT8 vectors dequantized to FP32 on cache insertion to preserve L1-resident lookup performance. Benchmarks on Apple M4 Max demonstrate that the combined architecture achieves 4.70ns INT8 dot product latency, 3.09us tree traversal at 100K nodes (3.4x over FP32), and P99 read latency of 750ns under hostile 16-thread contention via epoch-based reclamation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-turn dialogues and context-intensive tasks challenge Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate long histories without sacrificing generation quality. Although prefix LLMs can better exploit historical context via bidirectional attention on prefix tokens, they are rarely used in practice because multi-turn training requires many duplicated triplets, and its bidirectional prefix prevents KV-cache reuse at inference time, driving up high cost and latency. To retain the contextual understanding of prefix mask while preserving the inference-time efficiency of causal mask, we introduce Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM), a masking scheme that injects sparse bidirectional attention into the causal backbone. ISM alternates bidirectional attention over query segments with unidirectional attention over answer segments, enabling the synthesis of in-context while preserving global causality. This design eliminates triplet expansion during training and maintains KV-cache reuse during inference, yielding latency comparable to standard causal LLMs. ISM is architecture-agnostic and parameter-free, adding only minimal latency. Across extensive evaluations, ISM outperforms causal baselines not only on multi-turn dialogue, but also on context-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training Large Language Models (LLMs) on long contexts is severely constrained by prohibitive GPU memory overhead, not training time. The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/OOMB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study majorization-minimization methods for nonnegative tensor decompositions under the $β$-divergence family, focusing on nonnegative CP and Tucker models. Our aim is to avoid explicit mode unfoldings and large auxiliary matrices by deriving separable surrogates whose multiplicative updates can be implemented using only tensor contractions (einsum-style operations). We present both classical block-MM updates in contraction-only form and a joint majorization strategy, inspired by joint MM for matrix $β$-NMF, that reuses cached reference quantities across inexpensive inner updates. We prove tightness of the proposed majorizers, establish monotonic decrease of the objective, and show convergence of the sequence of objective values; we also discuss how BSUM theory applies to the block-MM scheme for analyzing limit points. Finally, experiments on synthetic tensors and the Uber spatiotemporal count tensor demonstrate substantial speedups over unfolding-based baselines and a recent einsum-factorization framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Model selection is a central task in statistics, but standard methods are not robust in misspecified settings where the true data-generating process (DGP) is not in the set of candidate models. The key limitation is that existing methods -- including information criteria and Bayesian posteriors -- do not quantify uncertainty about how well each candidate model approximates the true DGP. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to model selection based on modeling the likelihood values themselves. Specifically, given $K$ candidate models and $n$ observations, we view the $n\times K$ matrix of negative log-likelihood values as a random data matrix and observe that the expectation of each row is equal to the vector of Kullback--Leibler divergences between the $K$ models and the true DGP, up to an additive constant. We use a multivariate normal model to estimate and quantify uncertainty in this expectation, providing calibrated inferences for robust model selection under misspecification. The procedure is easy to compute, interpretable, and comes with theoretical guarantees, including consistency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI-powered scientific research tools are rapidly being integrated into research workflows, yet the field lacks a clear lens into how researchers use these systems in real-world settings. We present and analyze the Asta Interaction Dataset, a large-scale resource comprising over 200,000 user queries and interaction logs from two deployed tools (a literature discovery interface and a scientific question-answering interface) within an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation platform. Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage evolves with experience. We find that users submit longer and more complex queries than in traditional search, and treat the system as a collaborative research partner, delegating tasks such as drafting content and identifying research gaps. Users treat generated responses as persistent artifacts, revisiting and navigating among outputs and cited evidence in non-linear ways. With experience, users issue more targeted queries and engage more deeply with supporting citations, although keyword-style queries persist even among experienced users. We release the anonymized dataset and analysis with a new query intent taxonomy to inform future designs of real-world AI research assistants and to support realistic evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques -- such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO, as well as alternatives like DPO -- reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given that these models are widely deployed in applications requiring varied outputs. We argue that diversity without consideration of quality has limited practical value. To address this issue, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity -- diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds -- which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: when using diversity metrics that do not explicitly consider quality, preference-tuned models -- particularly those trained via RL -- often produce outputs with lower diversity; however, these same preference-tuned models generate greater effective semantic diversity than supervised fine-tuned (SFT) or base models. Our analysis further shows another trend: while larger models may exhibit greater effective semantic diversity than smaller models, the smaller models are consistently more parameter-efficient at producing unique content within a fixed sampling budget. These findings have practical implications for applications that require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic data generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $ρ$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Consider a marketplace of AI tools, each with slightly different strengths and weaknesses. By selecting the right model for the task at hand, a user can do better than simply committing to a single model for everything. Routers operate under a similar principle, where sophisticated model selection can increase overall performance. However, aggregation is often noisy, reflecting in imperfect user choices or routing decisions. This leads to two main questions: first, what does a "healthy marketplace" of models look like for maximizing consumer utility? Secondly, how can we incentivize producers to create such models? Here, we study two types of model changes: market entry (where an entirely new model is created and added to the set of available models), and model replacement (where an existing model has its strengths and weaknesses changed). We show that winrate, a standard benchmark in LLM evaluation, can incentivize model creators to homogenize for both types of model changes, reducing consumer welfare. We propose a new mechanism, weighted winrate, which rewards models for answers that are higher quality, and show that it provably improves incentives for producers to specialize and increases consumer welfare. We conclude by demonstrating that our theoretical results generalize to empirical benchmark datasets and discussing implications for evaluation design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a cluster-based generative image segmentation framework to encode higher-level representations of visual concepts based on one-shot learning inspired by the Omniglot Challenge. The inferred parameters of each component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) represent a distinct topological subpart of a visual concept. Sampling new data from these parameters generates augmented subparts to build a more robust prototype for each concept, i.e., the Abstracted Gaussian Prototype (AGP). This framework addresses one-shot classification tasks using a cognitively-inspired similarity metric and addresses one-shot generative tasks through a novel AGP-VAE pipeline employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new class variants. Results from human judges reveal that the generative pipeline produces novel examples and classes of visual concepts that are broadly indistinguishable from those made by humans. The proposed framework leads to impressive, but not state-of-the-art, classification accuracy; thus, the contribution is two-fold: 1) the system is low in theoretical and computational complexity yet achieves the standard of 'true' one-shot learning by operating in a fully standalone manner unlike existing approaches that draw heavily on pre-training or knowledge engineering; and 2) in contrast with existing neural network approaches, the AGP approach addresses the importance of broad task capability emphasized in the Omniglot challenge (successful performance on classification and generative tasks). These two points are critical in advancing our understanding of how learning and reasoning systems can produce viable, robust, and flexible concepts based on literally no more than a single example.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The study of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured spatially varying confounders has garnered increasing attention. However, a general framework for identifiability, which is critical for reliable causal inference from observational data, has yet to be advanced. In this paper, we study a linear model with various parametric model assumptions on the covariance structure between the unmeasured confounder and the exposure of interest. We establish identifiability of the treatment effect for many commonly 20 used spatial models for both discrete and continuous data, under mild conditions on the structure of observation locations and the exposure-confounder association. We also emphasize models or scenarios where identifiability may not hold, under which statistical inference should be conducted with caution.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating, yet the infrastructure for discovering, evaluating, and governing them remains fragmented compared to mature ecosystems like software package registries (e.g., npm) and model hubs (e.g., Hugging Face). Existing efforts typically address naming, distribution, or protocol descriptors, but stop short of providing a registry layer that makes agents discoverable, comparable, and governable under automated reuse. We present AgentHub, a registry layer and accompanying research agenda for agent sharing that targets discovery and workflow integration, trust and security, openness and governance, ecosystem interoperability, lifecycle transparency, and capability clarity with evidence. We describe a reference prototype that implements a canonical manifest with publish-time validation, version-bound evidence records linked to auditable artifacts, and an append-only lifecycle event log whose states are respected by default in search and resolution. We also provide initial discovery results using an LLM-as-judge recommendation pipeline, showing how structured contracts and evidence improve intent-accurate retrieval beyond keyword-driven discovery. AgentHub aims to provide a common substrate for building reliable, reusable agent ecosystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many AI alignment discussions of "runaway optimisation" focus on RL agents: unbounded utility maximisers that over-optimise a proxy objective (e.g., "paperclip maximiser", specification gaming) at the expense of everything else. LLM-based systems are often assumed to be safer because they function as next-token predictors rather than persistent optimisers. In this work, we empirically test this assumption by placing LLMs in simple, long-horizon control-style environments that require maintaining state of or balancing objectives over time: sustainability of a renewable resource, single- and multi-objective homeostasis, and balancing unbounded objectives with diminishing returns. We find that, although models frequently behave appropriately for many steps and clearly understand the stated objectives, they often lose context in structured ways and drift into runaway behaviours: ignoring homeostatic targets, collapsing from multi-objective trade-offs into single-objective maximisation - thus failing to respect concave utility structures. These failures emerge reliably after initial periods of competent behaviour and exhibit characteristic patterns (including self-imitative oscillations, unbounded maximisation, and reverting to single-objective optimisation). The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent - the failures systematically resemble runaway optimisers. Our results suggest that long-horizon, multi-objective misalignment is a genuine and under-evaluated failure mode in LLM agents, even in extremely simple settings with transparent and explicitly multi-objective feedback. Although LLMs appear multi-objective and bounded on the surface, their behaviour under sustained interaction, particularly involving multiple objectives, resembles brittle, poorly aligned optimisers whose effective objective gradually shifts toward unbounded and single-metric maximisation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The unique Galactic Center non-thermal filaments (NTFs) have been a focus of investigations for over 40 years. The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI is increasingly transforming creativity into a hybrid human-artificial process, but its impact on the quality and diversity of creative output remains unclear. We study collective creativity using a controlled word-guessing task that balances open-endedness with an objective measure of task performance. Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity, or other factors. Here we propose a statistical framework based on Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to simultaneously assess their autograders while addressing their primary research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In addition, our method can be used to augment traditional metrics such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and clarifying sources of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling both performance analysis and bias detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly, but existing methods typically output only the final composited video and lack editable layered representations, limiting their use in professional workflows. We propose \textbf{LayerT2V}, a unified multi-layer video generation framework that produces multiple semantically consistent outputs in a single inference pass: the full video, an independent background layer, and multiple foreground RGB layers with corresponding alpha mattes. Our key insight is that recent video generation backbones use high compression in both time and space, enabling us to serialize multiple layer representations along the temporal dimension and jointly model them on a shared generation trajectory. This turns cross-layer consistency into an intrinsic objective, improving semantic alignment and temporal coherence. To mitigate layer ambiguity and conditional leakage, we augment a shared DiT backbone with LayerAdaLN and layer-aware cross-attention modulation. LayerT2V is trained in three stages: alpha mask VAE adaptation, joint multi-layer learning, and multi-foreground extension. We also introduce \textbf{VidLayer}, the first large-scale dataset for multi-layer video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerT2V substantially outperforms prior methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and cross-layer coherence.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Combinatorial optimization problems near algorithmic phase transitions represent a fundamental challenge for both classical algorithms and machine learning approaches. Among them, graph coloring stands as a prototypical constraint satisfaction problem exhibiting sharp dynamical and satisfiability thresholds. Here we introduce a physics-inspired neural framework that learns to solve large-scale graph coloring instances by combining graph neural networks with statistical-mechanics principles. Our approach integrates a planting-based supervised signal, symmetry-breaking regularization, and iterative noise-annealed neural dynamics to navigate clustered solution landscapes. When the number of iterations scales quadratically with graph size, the learned solver reaches algorithmic thresholds close to the theoretical dynamical transition in random graphs and achieves near-optimal detection performance in the planted inference regime. The model generalizes from small training graphs to instances orders of magnitude larger, demonstrating that neural architectures can learn scalable algorithmic strategies that remain effective in hard connectivity regions. These results establish a general paradigm for learning neural solvers that operate near fundamental phase boundaries in combinatorial optimization and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While recent planet-formation models broadly reproduce the observed population of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, as well as the bimodal radius distribution (the ``radius valley''), it remains unclear whether all these planets share a common rocky composition (a single popoulation of planets) or instead comprise two distinct populations -- rocky planets and icy planets (two populations of planets). The inferred eccentricity-radius relation, which shows a modest peak near the radius valley, provides a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between these scenarios. Here we use N-body simulations to examine how the radii and eccentricities of close-in planets depend on the masses and orbital configurations of their progenitor protoplanets. We find that final planetary eccentricities scale with the system initial Safronov number. In two-population systems, energy equipartition between rocky and relatively more massive icy protoplanets creates a strong eccentricity contrast between the two groups, which appears as a peak near the radius valley. This signature does not appear if planetary systems are composed exclusively of rocky planets (with or without H-rich atmospheres), as assumed in photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Because the eccentricity-radius relation traces a dichotomy in the underlying protoplanet mass distribution -- most plausibly arising from formation at different disk locations -- our results suggest that a significant fraction of mini-Neptunes are water-worlds. The observed radius and eccentricity distributions may reflect a mixture of systems that host exclusively rocky planets, systems dominated by icy planets, and systems with both rocky and icy planets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale commercial search systems optimize for relevance to drive successful sessions that help users find what they are looking for. To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Evaluating sports players based on their performance shares core challenges with evaluating healthcare providers based on patient outcomes. Drawing on recent advances in healthcare provider profiling, we cast sports player evaluation within a rigorous causal inference framework and define a flexible class of causal player evaluation estimands. Using stochastic interventions, we compare player success rates on repeated tasks (such as field goal attempts or plate appearance) to counterfactual success rates had those same attempts been randomly reassigned to players according to prespecified reference distributions. This setup encompasses direct and indirect standardization parameters familiar from healthcare provider profiling, and we additionally propose a "performance above random replacement" estimand designed for interpretability in sports settings. We develop doubly robust estimators for these evaluation metrics based on modern semiparametric statistical methods, with a focus on Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation, and incorporate machine learning methods to capture complex relationships driving player performance. We illustrate our framework in detailed case studies of field goal kickers in the National Football League and batters in Major League Baseball, highlighting how different causal estimands yield distinct interpretations and insights about player performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/intelligence-per-watt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> I/O performance is crucial to efficiency in data-intensive scientific computing; but tuning large-scale storage systems is complex, costly, and notoriously manpower-intensive, making it inaccessible for most domain scientists. To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal parameter configurations for parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications.   STELLAR differs fundamentally from traditional autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR enables autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning by (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations.   We evaluate the impact of each component on optimization outcomes, providing design insights for similar systems in other optimization domains. STELLAR's architecture and empirical results highlight a promising approach to complex system optimization, especially for problems with large search spaces and high exploration costs, while making I/O tuning more accessible to domain scientists with minimal added resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Function contract generation is a classical problem in program analysis that targets the automated analysis of functions in a program with multiple procedures. The problem is fundamental in inter-procedural analysis where properties of functions are first obtained via the generation of function contracts and then the generated contracts are used as building blocks to analyze the whole program. Typical objectives in function contract generation include pre-/post-conditions and assigns information (that specifies the modification information over program variables and memory segments during function execution). In programs with array manipulations, a crucial point in function contract generation is the treatment of array segments that imposes challenges in inferring invariants and assigns information over such segments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel symbolic execution framework that carries invariants and assigns information over contiguous segments of arrays. We implement our framework as a prototype within LLVM, and further integrate our prototype with the ACSL assertion format and the Frama-C software verification platform. Experimental evaluation over a variety of benchmarks from the literature and functions from realistic libraries shows that our framework is capable of handling array manipulating functions that indeed involve the carry of array information and are beyond existing approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we introduce the first framework for Motion-aware Event Suppression, which learns to filter events triggered by IMOs and ego-motion in real time. Our model jointly segments IMOs in the current event stream while predicting their future motion, enabling anticipatory suppression of dynamic events before they occur. Our lightweight architecture achieves 173 Hz inference on consumer-grade GPUs with less than 1 GB of memory usage, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging EVIMO benchmark by 67\% in segmentation accuracy while operating at a 53\% higher inference rate. Moreover, we demonstrate significant benefits for downstream applications: our method accelerates Vision Transformer inference by 83\% via token pruning and improves event-based visual odometry accuracy, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 13\%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.

We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok. The multi-agent case study demonstrates real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.6), providing empirical evidence of the architecture's scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal discovery is the subfield of causal inference concerned with estimating the structure of cause-and-effect relationships in a system of interrelated variables, as opposed to quantifying the strength of causal effects. As interest in causal discovery builds in fields such as ecology, public health, and environmental sciences where data is regularly collected with spatial and temporal structures, approaches must evolve to manage autocorrelation and complex confounding. As it stands, the few proposed causal discovery algorithms for spatiotemporal data require summarizing across locations, ignore spatial autocorrelation, and/or scale poorly to high dimensions. Here, we introduce a developing framework that extends time-series causal discovery to systems with spatial structure, building upon work on causal discovery across contexts and methods for handling spatial confounding in causal effect estimation. We close by outlining remaining gaps in the literature and directions for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Consistency regularization (CR) improves the robustness and accuracy of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) by ensuring predictions remain stable across input perturbations. In this work, we propose Align-Consistency, an extension of CR designed for Align-Refine -- a non-autoregressive (non-AR) model that performs iterative refinement of frame-level hypotheses. This method leverages the speed of parallel inference while significantly boosting recognition performance. The effectiveness of Align-Consistency is demonstrated in two settings. First, in the fully supervised setting, our results indicate that applying CR to both the base CTC model and the subsequent refinement steps is critical, and the accuracy improvements from non-AR decoding and CR are mutually additive. Second, for semi-supervised ASR, we employ fast non-AR decoding to generate online pseudo-labels on unlabeled data, which are used to further refine the supervised model and lead to substantial gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve near-saturation accuracy on many established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, raising concerns about their ability to diagnose genuine reasoning competence. This saturation largely stems from the dominance of template-based computation and shallow arithmetic decomposition in existing datasets, which underrepresent reasoning skills such as multi-constraint coordination, constructive logical synthesis, and spatial inference. To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.   We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences and technical factors, such as amplification bias and limited RNA capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness, in spite of its known bias in high dimensions. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening algorithm which self-consistently estimates the magnitude of transcriptomic noise affecting each gene in individual cells, without assuming a specific noise distribution. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

Conventional rule-based or purely data-driven approaches struggle with the inherent high uncertainty of these long-tail scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework grounded in Active Inference, which endows the agent with a human-like, belief-driven mechanism. Our framework leverages a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to efficiently estimate the pedestrian's hybrid state. To emulate human-like cognitive processes under uncertainty, we introduce a Conditional Belief Reset mechanism and a Hypothesis Injection technique to explicitly model beliefs about the pedestrian's multiple latent intentions. Planning is achieved via a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which synergizes the efficient, iterative search of CEM with the inherent robustness of MPPI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the collision rate compared to reactive, rule-based, and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, while also exhibiting explainable and human-like driving behavior that reflects the agent's internal belief state.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Sharing information from multiple distinct yet related physical systems can alleviate this ill-possendess. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard multi-system Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of a specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ranking models, i.e., coarse-ranking and fine-ranking models, serve as core components in large-scale recommendation systems, responsible for scoring massive item candidates based on user preferences. To meet the stringent latency requirements of online serving, structural lightweighting or knowledge distillation techniques are commonly employed for ranking model acceleration. However, these approaches typically lead to a non-negligible drop in accuracy. Notably, the angle of lossless acceleration by optimizing feature fusion matrix multiplication, particularly through structural reparameterization, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MaRI, a novel Matrix Re-parameterized Inference framework, which serves as a complementary approach to existing techniques while accelerating ranking model inference without any accuracy loss. MaRI is motivated by the observation that user-side computation is redundant in feature fusion matrix multiplication, and we therefore adopt the philosophy of structural reparameterization to alleviate such redundancy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models (LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems increasingly leverage Large Language Model (LLM) architectures to achieve scalable, high-fidelity, zero-shot generation. However, these systems typically rely on fixed-frame-rate acoustic tokenization, resulting in speech sequences that are significantly longer than, and asynchronous with their corresponding text. Beyond computational inefficiency, this sequence length disparity often triggers hallucinations in TTS and amplifies the modality gap in spoken language modeling (SLM). In this paper, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that establishes one-to-one synchronization between continuous acoustic features and text tokens, enabling unified, single-stream modeling within an LLM. We demonstrate that these synchronous tokens maintain high-fidelity audio reconstruction and can be effectively modeled in a latent space by a large language model with a flow matching head. Moreover, the ability to seamlessly toggle speech modality within the context enables text-only guidance--a technique that blends logits from text-only and text-speech modes to flexibly bridge the gap toward text-only LLM intelligence. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TTS and SLM systems while virtually eliminating content hallucinations and preserving linguistic integrity, all at a significantly reduced inference cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning (DL) libraries are widely used in critical applications, where even subtle silent bugs can lead to serious consequences. While existing DL fuzzing techniques have made progress in detecting crashes, they inherently struggle to detect silent bugs due to the lack of effective test programs and corresponding oracles.   Building on the observation that historical bug reports contain rich, underutilized information about silent bugs, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform versatile yet controlled bug transfer for silent bug fuzzing. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract context-aware bug patterns from historical issues, match semantically related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using functionality-based embeddings, and synthesize test cases with customized oracles. This enables proactive detection of silent bugs by transferring high-risk contexts and oracle designs from known buggy APIs to functionally similar target APIs. To ensure the reliability of our context-aware bug transfer, we introduce an LLM-powered self-validation module that systematically evaluates the validity of each transferred bug instance. We implement this methodology in a tool named TransFuzz and evaluate it on three mainstream DL libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. TransFuzz successfully discovers 79 previously unknown bugs (12 confirmed as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)) in 10 bug types, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability in migrating DL library bug discovery capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.   To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as "Text-to-Big SQL". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.   In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR) estimation $\frac{ρ_E}{ρ_π}$, where a discriminator estimates the relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert; and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives, relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions, i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably, DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines. Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code repair is a fundamental task in software development, facilitating efficient bug resolution and software maintenance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in automated code repair, their ability to comprehend and leverage diverse types of feedback, which is crucial for iterative self-correction in authentic debugging scenarios, remains insufficiently understood.   To bridge this gap, we introduce FeedbackEval, a systematic benchmark constructed from three heterogeneous sources (HumanEval, CoderEval, and SWE-Bench-verified), to evaluate LLMs' feedback comprehension and code repair performance. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Deepseek-R1, GLM-4, and Qwen2.5, to evaluate their behavior under both single-iteration and iterative code repair settings. Our results show that mixed feedback yields the highest repair success (63.6%), with LLM-Expert and test feedback providing strong targeted gains (62.9% and 57.9%, respectively), while minimal (53.1%) and compiler feedback (49.2%) offer moderate benefits and LLM-Skilled proves least effective (48.8%). Iterative feedback further enhances repair performance, though the marginal benefit diminishes after two or three iterations. Moreover, prompt structure is shown to be critical: structured reasoning (RR, CoT) and dynamic example selection deliver notable improvements, whereas removing semantic cues such as docstrings or role-play causes severe degradation. This work introduces a robust benchmark and delivers practical insights to advance the understanding and development of feedback-driven code repair using LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Line intensity mapping provides a statistical approach to tracing the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe. We apply the HI intensity mapping technique to interferometric data from the MeerKAT International GHz-Tiered Extragalactic Explorations (MIGHTEE) Survey, analysing 17.5 hours of a single pointing in the COSMOS field, using a 60 MHz sub-band in the frequency range 1332 - 1392 MHz ($0.02 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.07$). Using a delay-spectrum-based estimator, we measure the HI power spectrum on sub-megaparsec scales and compare it directly to the power spectrum inferred from a catalogue of individually detected HI galaxies in the same field. After mitigating low-level broadband contamination through conservative outlier flagging in the three-dimensional power spectrum, cross-correlation of time-split visibilities yields a statistically significant detection on scales $3 \lesssim k \lesssim 20 \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a total signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 13$. Over this range, the power spectra obtained from visibilities and detected galaxies are consistent within uncertainties and have comparable amplitudes of order $10^{-2}$ - $10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{mK}^2 \mathrm{Mpc}^3$. End-to-end validation is performed by propagating detected galaxies through the power spectrum estimator via both direct intensity-field construction and simulated visibilities, demonstrating agreement up to $k \sim 20 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, beyond which measurements become noise-dominated. A statistically significant correlation is also observed between the data and the simulated visibilities from the detected HI galaxies, which should be free of systematics. These results provide a self-consistent validation of interferometric HI intensity mapping at low redshift and demonstrate agreement with galaxy-based measurements within the same cosmological volume.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep state-space models (DSSMs) enable temporal predictions by learning the underlying dynamics of observed sequence data. They are often trained by maximising the evidence lower bound. However, as we show, this does not ensure the model actually learns the underlying dynamics. We therefore propose a constrained optimisation framework as a general approach for training DSSMs. Building upon this, we introduce the extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE), which combines amortised variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing to model dynamics more accurately than RNN-based DSSMs. Our results show that the constrained optimisation framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on the example of established state-of-the-art DSSMs. The EKVAE outperforms previous models w.r.t. prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable results in identifying dynamical systems, and can furthermore successfully learn state-space representations where static and dynamic features are disentangled.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75% reduction in memory footprint, 124% faster inference, and a 5.9% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be made available at https://github.com/seamie6/SuperQuadricOcc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context engineering has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) tasks, enabling performance gains at test time without model fine-tuning. Despite its success, existing research lacks a systematic taxonomy of SE-specific context types and a dedicated benchmark to quantify the heterogeneous effects of different contexts across core SE workflows. To address this gap, we propose CL4SE (Context Learning for Software Engineering), a comprehensive benchmark featuring a fine-grained taxonomy of four SE-oriented context types (interpretable examples, project-specific context, procedural decision-making context, and positive & negative context), each mapped to a representative task (code generation, code summarization, code review, and patch correctness assessment). We construct high-quality datasets comprising over 13,000 samples from more than 30 open-source projects and evaluate five mainstream LLMs across nine metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that context learning yields an average performance improvement of 24.7% across all tasks. Specifically, procedural context boosts code review performance by up to 33% (Qwen3-Max), mixed positive-negative context improves patch assessment by 30% (DeepSeek-V3), project-specific context increases code summarization BLEU by 14.78% (GPT-Oss-120B), and interpretable examples enhance code generation PASS@1 by 5.72% (DeepSeek-V3). CL4SE establishes the first standardized evaluation framework for SE context learning, provides actionable empirical insights into task-specific context design, and releases a large-scale dataset to facilitate reproducible research in this domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sensitivity and specificity evaluated at an optimal diagnostic cut-off are fundamental measures of classification accuracy when continuous biomarkers are used for disease diagnosis. Joint inference for these quantities is challenging because their estimators are evaluated at a common, data-driven threshold estimated from both diseased and healthy samples, inducing statistical dependence. Existing approaches are largely based on parametric assumptions or fully nonparametric procedures, which may be sensitive to model misspecification or lack efficiency in moderate samples. We propose a semiparametric framework for joint inference on sensitivity and specificity at the Youden-optimal cut-off under the density ratio model. Using maximum empirical likelihood, we derive estimators of the optimal threshold and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity, and establish their joint asymptotic normality. This leads to Wald-type and range-preserving logit-transformed confidence regions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves accurate coverage with improved efficiency relative to existing parametric and nonparametric alternatives across a variety of distributional settings. An analysis of COVID-19 antibody data demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed approach for diagnostic decision-making.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Developing culturally grounded multilingual AI systems remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. While synthetic data offers promise, its effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts is underexplored. We investigate bottom-up synthetic data generation using large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) grounded in language-specific Wikipedia content, complementing dominant top-down translation-based approaches from English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages and English, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks. Comprehensive evaluation using automated metrics and 10K human assessments confirms high data quality. Downstream evaluations performed by fine-tuning models on various datasets and assessing performance across 13 diverse multilingual datasets and model comparative evaluations, demonstrate that models trained on Updesh consistently obtain significant improvements on NLU, NLG evaluations. Finally, through ablation studies and cultural evaluations, we show that context-aware, culturally grounded data generation is essential for effective multilingual AI development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based real-time object detectors achieve strong accuracy-latency trade-offs, and D-FINE is among the top-performing recent architectures. However, real-time instance segmentation with transformers is still less common. We present D-FINE-seg, an instance segmentation extension of D-FINE that adds: a lightweight mask head, segmentation-aware training, including box cropped BCE and dice mask losses, auxiliary and denoising mask supervision, and adapted Hungarian matching cost. On the TACO dataset, D-FINE-seg improves F1-score over Ultralytics YOLO26 under a unified TensorRT FP16 end-to-end benchmarking protocol, while maintaining competitive latency. Second contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for training, exporting, and optimized inference across ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training large neural networks exposes neural scaling laws for the generalization error, which points to a universal behavior across network architectures of learning in high dimensions. It was also shown that this effect persists in the limit of highly overparametrized networks as well as the Neural network Gaussian process limit. We here develop a principled understanding of the typical behavior of generalization in Neural Network Gaussian process regression dynamics. We derive a dynamical mean-field theory that captures the typical case learning dynamics: This allows us to unify multiple existing regimes of learning studied in the current literature, namely Bayesian inference on Gaussian processes, gradient flow with or without weight-decay, and stochastic Langevin training dynamics. Employing tools from statistical physics, the unified framework we derive in either of these cases yields an effective description of the high-dimensional microscopic behavior of networks dynamics in terms of lower dimensional order parameters. We show that collective training dynamics may be separated into the dynamics of N independent eigenmodes, those evolution equations are only coupled through collective response functions and a common statistics of an effective, independent noise. Our approach allows us to quantitatively explain the dynamics of the generalization error by linking spectral and dynamical properties of learning on data with power law spectra, including phenomena such as neural scaling laws and the effect of early stopping.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) serving infrastructures are undergoing a shift toward heterogeneity and disaggregation. Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.   This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations. These results demonstrate that LLMServingSim 2.0 provides a practical bridge between hardware innovation and serving-system design, enabling systematic exploration and co-design for next-generation LLM serving infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this, speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures, they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.   Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure. Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5 % to 20%. The code is available at https://github.com/EAGLE-Research/sglang-eagle4.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal inference is only valid when its underlying assumptions are satisfied, one of the most central being the ignorability or unconfoundedness assumption. However, this hypothesis is often unrealistic in observational studies, as some confounding variables may remain unobserved. To address this limitation, sensitivity models for Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) estimators, known as Marginal Sensitivity Models, have been introduced, allowing for a controlled relaxation of ignorability. A substantial body of literature has emerged around these models, aiming to derive sharp and robust bounds for both binary and continuous treatment effects. A key element of these approaches is the specification of a sensitivity parameter, referred to as the "confounding strength", which quantifies the extent of deviation from ignorability. Yet, determining an appropriate value for this parameter is challenging, and the final interpretation of sensitivity analyses can be unclear. We believe these difficulties represent major obstacles to the adoption of such methods in practice. Therefore, after introducing sensitivity analyses for IPW estimators, we review different strategies to estimate or lower bound the confounding strength, introduce a new method leveraging negative controls, provide a decision tree with guidelines to choose a suitable approach, and compare the methodologies in an in-depth simulation study.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Tully-Fisher (TF) and Fundamental Plane (FP) relations are widely used to infer extragalactic distances and peculiar velocities, enabling measurements of large-scale velocity statistics and cosmological parameters. Using the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation, we assess the accuracy of these methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\sim10\,\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the environments of massive quiescent galaxies at 3 < z < 5 using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) theoretical model. We select galaxies with stellar mass ~10^10.8 Msun and specific star formation rate below 0.3x t_Hubble, yielding in a sample of about 5,000 galaxies within a simulated volume of ~685 Mpc. These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Whole-body mobile manipulation is a fundamental capability for general-purpose robotic agents, requiring both coordinated control of the mobile base and manipulator and robust perception under dynamically changing viewpoints. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: strong coupling between base and arm actions complicates whole-body control optimization, and perceptual attention is often poorly allocated as viewpoints shift during mobile manipulation. We propose InCoM, an intent-driven perception and structured coordination framework for whole-body mobile manipulation. InCoM infers latent motion intent to dynamically reweight multi-scale perceptual features, enabling stage-adaptive allocation of perceptual attention. To support robust cross-modal perception, InCoM further incorporates a geometric-semantic structured alignment mechanism that enhances multimodal correspondence. On the control side, we design a decoupled coordinated flow matching action decoder that explicitly models coordinated base-arm action generation, alleviating optimization difficulties caused by control coupling. Without access to privileged perceptual information, InCoM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three ManiSkill-HAB scenarios by 28.2%, 26.1%, and 23.6% in success rate, demonstrating strong effectiveness for whole-body mobile manipulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Under gang scheduling for large-scale distributed large language model (LLM) training, a single network anomaly can stall or abort an entire job. Current network fault tolerance mechanisms typically adopt a ``fallback and bypass'' approach within the switching fabric and at the access layer, tolerating in-network and access-layer failures.   We explore whether RDMA fault tolerance can be extended to the cross-NIC level by failing over traffic to intra-host backup NICs. For the first time, we prove a fundamental Trilemma: it is impossible to have Cross-NIC RDMA failover that simultaneously preserves Exactly-Once Execution, Receiver-NIC Opacity, and a Zero-Copy datapath.   Fortunately, we observe that dominant training frameworks (e.g., NCCL) rely on idempotent bulk transfers that tolerate relaxed memory ordering, as long as notification ordering is preserved. Leveraging this insight, we present SHIFT, a user-space RDMA layer that provides cross-NIC fault tolerance while preserving correct memory semantics. We implement SHIFT in \texttt{rdma-core} and evaluate it with PyTorch distributed training. Results show that SHIFT incurs negligible overhead during normal operation and successfully masks fatal NIC failures and link anomalies, allowing training to continue without costly restarts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applying LLM-based multi-agent software systems in safety-critical domains such as lifespan echocardiography introduces system-level risks that cannot be addressed by improving model accuracy alone. During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings. These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised (e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating codebook learning with contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII) from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference. Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising hardware platform for shaping wireless propagation environments at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies and beyond. While many existing studies emphasize channel modeling and signal processing, practical RIS deployment is fundamentally governed by hardware design choices and their system-level implications. This paper presents a hardware-centric overview of recent mm-Wave RIS developments, covering wideband realizations, high-resolution phase-quantized designs, fully printed low-cost implementations, optically transparent surfaces, RIS-on-chip solutions, and emerging three-dimensional architectures. Key challenges including mutual coupling, calibration, multi-RIS interaction, and frequency-dependent phase control are discussed to bridge hardware realization with system-level optimization. This overview provides practical design insights and aims to guide future RIS research toward scalable, efficient, and practically deployable intelligent surface architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI-powered scientific research tools are rapidly being integrated into research workflows, yet the field lacks a clear lens into how researchers use these systems in real-world settings. We present and analyze the Asta Interaction Dataset, a large-scale resource comprising over 200,000 user queries and interaction logs from two deployed tools (a literature discovery interface and a scientific question-answering interface) within an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation platform. Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage evolves with experience. We find that users submit longer and more complex queries than in traditional search, and treat the system as a collaborative research partner, delegating tasks such as drafting content and identifying research gaps. Users treat generated responses as persistent artifacts, revisiting and navigating among outputs and cited evidence in non-linear ways. With experience, users issue more targeted queries and engage more deeply with supporting citations, although keyword-style queries persist even among experienced users. We release the anonymized dataset and analysis with a new query intent taxonomy to inform future designs of real-world AI research assistants and to support realistic evaluation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work suggests that preference-tuning techniques -- such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods like PPO and GRPO, as well as alternatives like DPO -- reduce diversity, creating a dilemma given that these models are widely deployed in applications requiring varied outputs. We argue that diversity without consideration of quality has limited practical value. To address this issue, we introduce a framework for measuring effective semantic diversity -- diversity among outputs that meet quality thresholds -- which better reflects the practical utility of large language models (LLMs). Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: when using diversity metrics that do not explicitly consider quality, preference-tuned models -- particularly those trained via RL -- often produce outputs with lower diversity; however, these same preference-tuned models generate greater effective semantic diversity than supervised fine-tuned (SFT) or base models. Our analysis further shows another trend: while larger models may exhibit greater effective semantic diversity than smaller models, the smaller models are consistently more parameter-efficient at producing unique content within a fixed sampling budget. These findings have practical implications for applications that require diverse yet high-quality outputs, from creative assistance to synthetic data generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) presents unique challenges, requiring models to capture the temporal flow of multi-turn dialogues and to effectively integrate cues from multiple modalities. We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems. We also provide various ablations to highlight the contributions made in the proposed approach.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $ρ$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Consider a marketplace of AI tools, each with slightly different strengths and weaknesses. By selecting the right model for the task at hand, a user can do better than simply committing to a single model for everything. Routers operate under a similar principle, where sophisticated model selection can increase overall performance. However, aggregation is often noisy, reflecting in imperfect user choices or routing decisions. This leads to two main questions: first, what does a "healthy marketplace" of models look like for maximizing consumer utility? Secondly, how can we incentivize producers to create such models? Here, we study two types of model changes: market entry (where an entirely new model is created and added to the set of available models), and model replacement (where an existing model has its strengths and weaknesses changed). We show that winrate, a standard benchmark in LLM evaluation, can incentivize model creators to homogenize for both types of model changes, reducing consumer welfare. We propose a new mechanism, weighted winrate, which rewards models for answers that are higher quality, and show that it provably improves incentives for producers to specialize and increases consumer welfare. We conclude by demonstrating that our theoretical results generalize to empirical benchmark datasets and discussing implications for evaluation design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating, yet the infrastructure for discovering, evaluating, and governing them remains fragmented compared to mature ecosystems like software package registries (e.g., npm) and model hubs (e.g., Hugging Face). Existing efforts typically address naming, distribution, or protocol descriptors, but stop short of providing a registry layer that makes agents discoverable, comparable, and governable under automated reuse. We present AgentHub, a registry layer and accompanying research agenda for agent sharing that targets discovery and workflow integration, trust and security, openness and governance, ecosystem interoperability, lifecycle transparency, and capability clarity with evidence. We describe a reference prototype that implements a canonical manifest with publish-time validation, version-bound evidence records linked to auditable artifacts, and an append-only lifecycle event log whose states are respected by default in search and resolution. We also provide initial discovery results using an LLM-as-judge recommendation pipeline, showing how structured contracts and evidence improve intent-accurate retrieval beyond keyword-driven discovery. AgentHub aims to provide a common substrate for building reliable, reusable agent ecosystems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many AI alignment discussions of "runaway optimisation" focus on RL agents: unbounded utility maximisers that over-optimise a proxy objective (e.g., "paperclip maximiser", specification gaming) at the expense of everything else. LLM-based systems are often assumed to be safer because they function as next-token predictors rather than persistent optimisers. In this work, we empirically test this assumption by placing LLMs in simple, long-horizon control-style environments that require maintaining state of or balancing objectives over time: sustainability of a renewable resource, single- and multi-objective homeostasis, and balancing unbounded objectives with diminishing returns. We find that, although models frequently behave appropriately for many steps and clearly understand the stated objectives, they often lose context in structured ways and drift into runaway behaviours: ignoring homeostatic targets, collapsing from multi-objective trade-offs into single-objective maximisation - thus failing to respect concave utility structures. These failures emerge reliably after initial periods of competent behaviour and exhibit characteristic patterns (including self-imitative oscillations, unbounded maximisation, and reverting to single-objective optimisation). The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent - the failures systematically resemble runaway optimisers. Our results suggest that long-horizon, multi-objective misalignment is a genuine and under-evaluated failure mode in LLM agents, even in extremely simple settings with transparent and explicitly multi-objective feedback. Although LLMs appear multi-objective and bounded on the surface, their behaviour under sustained interaction, particularly involving multiple objectives, resembles brittle, poorly aligned optimisers whose effective objective gradually shifts toward unbounded and single-metric maximisation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity, or other factors. Here we propose a statistical framework based on Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to simultaneously assess their autograders while addressing their primary research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In addition, our method can be used to augment traditional metrics such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and clarifying sources of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling both performance analysis and bias detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.   RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.   Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale commercial search systems optimize for relevance to drive successful sessions that help users find what they are looking for. To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/intelligence-per-watt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> I/O performance is crucial to efficiency in data-intensive scientific computing; but tuning large-scale storage systems is complex, costly, and notoriously manpower-intensive, making it inaccessible for most domain scientists. To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal parameter configurations for parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications.   STELLAR differs fundamentally from traditional autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR enables autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning by (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations.   We evaluate the impact of each component on optimization outcomes, providing design insights for similar systems in other optimization domains. STELLAR's architecture and empirical results highlight a promising approach to complex system optimization, especially for problems with large search spaces and high exploration costs, while making I/O tuning more accessible to domain scientists with minimal added resources.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok. The multi-agent case study demonstrates real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.6), providing empirical evidence of the architecture's scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve near-saturation accuracy on many established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, raising concerns about their ability to diagnose genuine reasoning competence. This saturation largely stems from the dominance of template-based computation and shallow arithmetic decomposition in existing datasets, which underrepresent reasoning skills such as multi-constraint coordination, constructive logical synthesis, and spatial inference. To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.   We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to capture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across diverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation (LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle, hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45% improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models (LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.

In this work, we present CiteLLM, a specialized agentic platform designed to enable trustworthy reference discovery for grounding author-drafted claims and statements. The system introduces a novel interaction paradigm by embedding LLM utilities directly within the LaTeX editor environment, ensuring a seamless user experience and no data transmission outside the local system. To guarantee hallucination-free references, we employ dynamic discipline-aware routing to retrieve candidates exclusively from trusted web-based academic repositories, while leveraging LLMs solely for generating context-aware search queries, ranking candidates by relevance, and validating and explaining support through paragraph-level semantic matching and an integrated chatbot. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system in returning valid and highly usable references.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems increasingly leverage Large Language Model (LLM) architectures to achieve scalable, high-fidelity, zero-shot generation. However, these systems typically rely on fixed-frame-rate acoustic tokenization, resulting in speech sequences that are significantly longer than, and asynchronous with their corresponding text. Beyond computational inefficiency, this sequence length disparity often triggers hallucinations in TTS and amplifies the modality gap in spoken language modeling (SLM). In this paper, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that establishes one-to-one synchronization between continuous acoustic features and text tokens, enabling unified, single-stream modeling within an LLM. We demonstrate that these synchronous tokens maintain high-fidelity audio reconstruction and can be effectively modeled in a latent space by a large language model with a flow matching head. Moreover, the ability to seamlessly toggle speech modality within the context enables text-only guidance--a technique that blends logits from text-only and text-speech modes to flexibly bridge the gap toward text-only LLM intelligence. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TTS and SLM systems while virtually eliminating content hallucinations and preserving linguistic integrity, all at a significantly reduced inference cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based) pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning (DL) libraries are widely used in critical applications, where even subtle silent bugs can lead to serious consequences. While existing DL fuzzing techniques have made progress in detecting crashes, they inherently struggle to detect silent bugs due to the lack of effective test programs and corresponding oracles.   Building on the observation that historical bug reports contain rich, underutilized information about silent bugs, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform versatile yet controlled bug transfer for silent bug fuzzing. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract context-aware bug patterns from historical issues, match semantically related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using functionality-based embeddings, and synthesize test cases with customized oracles. This enables proactive detection of silent bugs by transferring high-risk contexts and oracle designs from known buggy APIs to functionally similar target APIs. To ensure the reliability of our context-aware bug transfer, we introduce an LLM-powered self-validation module that systematically evaluates the validity of each transferred bug instance. We implement this methodology in a tool named TransFuzz and evaluate it on three mainstream DL libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. TransFuzz successfully discovers 79 previously unknown bugs (12 confirmed as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)) in 10 bug types, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability in migrating DL library bug discovery capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Case Report Forms (CRFs) collect data about patients and are at the core of well-established practices to conduct research in clinical settings. With the recent progress of language technologies, there is an increasing interest in automatic CRF-filling from clinical notes, mostly based on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours "unknown" answers), which need to be corrected.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.   To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as "Text-to-Big SQL". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.   In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR) estimation $\frac{ρ_E}{ρ_π}$, where a discriminator estimates the relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert; and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives, relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions, i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably, DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines. Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Code repair is a fundamental task in software development, facilitating efficient bug resolution and software maintenance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in automated code repair, their ability to comprehend and leverage diverse types of feedback, which is crucial for iterative self-correction in authentic debugging scenarios, remains insufficiently understood.   To bridge this gap, we introduce FeedbackEval, a systematic benchmark constructed from three heterogeneous sources (HumanEval, CoderEval, and SWE-Bench-verified), to evaluate LLMs' feedback comprehension and code repair performance. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Deepseek-R1, GLM-4, and Qwen2.5, to evaluate their behavior under both single-iteration and iterative code repair settings. Our results show that mixed feedback yields the highest repair success (63.6%), with LLM-Expert and test feedback providing strong targeted gains (62.9% and 57.9%, respectively), while minimal (53.1%) and compiler feedback (49.2%) offer moderate benefits and LLM-Skilled proves least effective (48.8%). Iterative feedback further enhances repair performance, though the marginal benefit diminishes after two or three iterations. Moreover, prompt structure is shown to be critical: structured reasoning (RR, CoT) and dynamic example selection deliver notable improvements, whereas removing semantic cues such as docstrings or role-play causes severe degradation. This work introduces a robust benchmark and delivers practical insights to advance the understanding and development of feedback-driven code repair using LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Occlusions present a significant challenge for connected and automated vehicles, as they can obscure critical road users from perception systems. Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture the cumulative nature of these threats over time adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel and universal risk assessment metric, the Risk of Tracking Loss (RTL), which aggregates instantaneous risk intensity throughout occluded periods. This provides a holistic risk profile that encompasses both high-intensity, short-term threats and prolonged exposure. Utilizing diverse and high-fidelity real-world datasets, a large-scale statistical analysis is conducted to characterize occlusion risk and validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The metric is applied to evaluate different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) deployment strategies. Our study shows that full V2X penetration theoretically eliminates this risk, the reduction is highly nonlinear; a substantial statistical benefit requires a high penetration threshold of 75-90%. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel asymmetric communication framework that allows even non-connected vehicles to receive warnings. Experimental results demonstrate that this paradigm achieves better risk mitigation performance. We found that our approach at 25% penetration outperforms the traditional symmetric model at 75%, and benefits saturate at only 50% penetration. This work provides a crucial risk assessment metric and a cost-effective, strategic roadmap for accelerating the safety benefits of V2X deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study continuous-time CRRA portfolio choice in diffusion markets with estimated and hence uncertain coefficients. Nature draws a latent parameter $θ\sim q$ at time $0$ and keeps it fixed; the investor never observes $θ$ and must commit to a single $θ$-blind policy maximizing an ex-ante objective, treating $q$ as a decision-time input. We propose a simulation-only two-stage solver.Stage 1 (DPO) performs BPTT-based stochastic gradient ascent through an Euler simulator while sampling $θ$ only inside the simulator. Stage 2 (Pontryagin projection) aggregates costate blocks across $θ\sim q$ and enforces the $q$-aggregated stationarity condition within the deployable class; the resulting correction can be amortized via interactive distillation. We refer to the full Stage 1 + Stage 2 pipeline as PG-DPO.We prove a uniform conditional BPTT-PMP correspondence and a residual-based policy-gap bound with explicit discretization and Monte Carlo error terms. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian drift-uncertainty and factor-driven benchmarks show that projection stabilizes learning and accurately recovers analytic decision-time references, while a model-free PPO baseline remains far from the targets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75% reduction in memory footprint, 124% faster inference, and a 5.9% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be made available at https://github.com/seamie6/SuperQuadricOcc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Context engineering has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) tasks, enabling performance gains at test time without model fine-tuning. Despite its success, existing research lacks a systematic taxonomy of SE-specific context types and a dedicated benchmark to quantify the heterogeneous effects of different contexts across core SE workflows. To address this gap, we propose CL4SE (Context Learning for Software Engineering), a comprehensive benchmark featuring a fine-grained taxonomy of four SE-oriented context types (interpretable examples, project-specific context, procedural decision-making context, and positive & negative context), each mapped to a representative task (code generation, code summarization, code review, and patch correctness assessment). We construct high-quality datasets comprising over 13,000 samples from more than 30 open-source projects and evaluate five mainstream LLMs across nine metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that context learning yields an average performance improvement of 24.7% across all tasks. Specifically, procedural context boosts code review performance by up to 33% (Qwen3-Max), mixed positive-negative context improves patch assessment by 30% (DeepSeek-V3), project-specific context increases code summarization BLEU by 14.78% (GPT-Oss-120B), and interpretable examples enhance code generation PASS@1 by 5.72% (DeepSeek-V3). CL4SE establishes the first standardized evaluation framework for SE context learning, provides actionable empirical insights into task-specific context design, and releases a large-scale dataset to facilitate reproducible research in this domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Developing culturally grounded multilingual AI systems remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. While synthetic data offers promise, its effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts is underexplored. We investigate bottom-up synthetic data generation using large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) grounded in language-specific Wikipedia content, complementing dominant top-down translation-based approaches from English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages and English, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks. Comprehensive evaluation using automated metrics and 10K human assessments confirms high data quality. Downstream evaluations performed by fine-tuning models on various datasets and assessing performance across 13 diverse multilingual datasets and model comparative evaluations, demonstrate that models trained on Updesh consistently obtain significant improvements on NLU, NLG evaluations. Finally, through ablation studies and cultural evaluations, we show that context-aware, culturally grounded data generation is essential for effective multilingual AI development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based real-time object detectors achieve strong accuracy-latency trade-offs, and D-FINE is among the top-performing recent architectures. However, real-time instance segmentation with transformers is still less common. We present D-FINE-seg, an instance segmentation extension of D-FINE that adds: a lightweight mask head, segmentation-aware training, including box cropped BCE and dice mask losses, auxiliary and denoising mask supervision, and adapted Hungarian matching cost. On the TACO dataset, D-FINE-seg improves F1-score over Ultralytics YOLO26 under a unified TensorRT FP16 end-to-end benchmarking protocol, while maintaining competitive latency. Second contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for training, exporting, and optimized inference across ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model (LLM) serving infrastructures are undergoing a shift toward heterogeneity and disaggregation. Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.   This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations. These results demonstrate that LLMServingSim 2.0 provides a practical bridge between hardware innovation and serving-system design, enabling systematic exploration and co-design for next-generation LLM serving infrastructures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this, speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures, they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.   Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure. Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5 % to 20%. The code is available at https://github.com/EAGLE-Research/sglang-eagle4.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Under gang scheduling for large-scale distributed large language model (LLM) training, a single network anomaly can stall or abort an entire job. Current network fault tolerance mechanisms typically adopt a ``fallback and bypass'' approach within the switching fabric and at the access layer, tolerating in-network and access-layer failures.   We explore whether RDMA fault tolerance can be extended to the cross-NIC level by failing over traffic to intra-host backup NICs. For the first time, we prove a fundamental Trilemma: it is impossible to have Cross-NIC RDMA failover that simultaneously preserves Exactly-Once Execution, Receiver-NIC Opacity, and a Zero-Copy datapath.   Fortunately, we observe that dominant training frameworks (e.g., NCCL) rely on idempotent bulk transfers that tolerate relaxed memory ordering, as long as notification ordering is preserved. Leveraging this insight, we present SHIFT, a user-space RDMA layer that provides cross-NIC fault tolerance while preserving correct memory semantics. We implement SHIFT in \texttt{rdma-core} and evaluate it with PyTorch distributed training. Results show that SHIFT incurs negligible overhead during normal operation and successfully masks fatal NIC failures and link anomalies, allowing training to continue without costly restarts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Applying LLM-based multi-agent software systems in safety-critical domains such as lifespan echocardiography introduces system-level risks that cannot be addressed by improving model accuracy alone. During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings. These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised (e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, the global potential of surface-based removal techniques has not yet been quantified based on limits of pollutant transport and removal rates. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for global-scale deployment across a variety of configurations, including air interaction with the built environment, mechanical ventilation and convection systems, and over the global transportation fleet Cities provide the highest removal potential, with median annual estimates of 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ and 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$ transported to their total surface area. Cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters have the potential to exceed 1 GtCO$_2$/yr (1 GtCO$_2$e/yr for CH$_4$, 20-year GWP) of removal when literature-based CO$_2$-sorbent (CH$_4$-catalyst) efficiencies are applied across their total surface area. These values represent theoretical upper bounds and are intended for comparison across applications rather than application-specific deployment. HVAC filters have the potential to achieve materials costs as low as \$600 per tCO$_2$ removed (\$2000 per tCO$_2$e) when CO$_2$-sorption (CH$_4$-catalyst) technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets and maintained through routine filter replacement, compared with \$3000 per tCO$_2$ (\$10000 per tCO$_2$e) for city surfaces, based on the literature values for these technologies' materials costs. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a pathway to advance climate and health objectives, though further studies are needed to assess their feasibility in application, and application-implementation rates and cost.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to increasing interest in agent-based systems. While most prior work in medical imaging concentrates on automating routine clinical workflows, we study an underexplored yet clinically significant setting: distinguishing visually hard-to-separate diseases in a zero-shot setting. We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management. We introduce a multi-agent framework based on contrastive adjudication. Experimental results show improved diagnostic performance (an 11-percentage-point gain in accuracy on dermoscopy data) and reduced unsupported claims on qualitative samples, although overall performance remains insufficient for clinical deployment. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in human annotations and the absence of clinical context, which further limit the translation to real-world settings. Within this controlled setting, this pilot study provides preliminary insights into zero-shot agent performance in visually confounded scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at http://github.com/james-oldfield/tpc.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantization-aware training (QAT) has achieved remarkable success in low-bit ($\leq$4-bit) quantization for classification networks. However, when applied to more complex visual tasks such as object detection and image segmentation, performance still suffers significant degradation. A key cause of this limitation has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this work, we revisit this phenomenon from a new perspective and identify a major failure factor: gradient imbalance at feature fusion stages, induced by accumulated quantization errors. This imbalance biases the optimization trajectory and impedes convergence under low-bit quantization. Based on this diagnosis, we propose Q$^2$, a two-pronged framework comprising: (1) Quantization-aware Gradient Balancing Fusion (Q-GBFusion), a closed-loop mechanism that dynamically rebalances gradient contributions during feature fusion; and (2) Quantization-aware Attention Distribution Alignment (Q-ADA), a parameter-free supervision strategy that reconstructs the supervision distribution using semantic relevance and quantization sensitivity, yielding more stable and reliable supervision to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method, as a plug-and-play and general strategy, can be integrated into various state-of-the-art QAT pipelines, achieving an average +2.5\% mAP gain on object detection and a +3.7\% mDICE improvement on image segmentation. Notably, it is applied only during training and introduces no inference-time overhead, making it highly practical for real-world deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards~(RLVR) has become a prominent paradigm to enhance the capabilities (i.e.\ long-context) of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, it often relies on gold-standard answers or explicit evaluation rubrics provided by powerful teacher models or human experts, which are costly and time-consuming. In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document. LLMs are trained through reinforcement learning to reconstruct the document by correctly identifying and sequencing missing paragraphs from a set of candidate options. This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of reward design, data curation strategies, training schemes, and data scaling effects on model performance. We publicly release our code, data, and models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Smartphones represent a uniquely challenging environment for agentic systems. Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires rethinking how reasoning and control are composed.   We introduce ClawMobile as a concrete exploration of this design space. ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways, improving execution stability and reproducibility on real devices. Using ClawMobile as a case study, we distill the design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. We argue that building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces. The implementation is open-sourced~\footnote{https://github.com/ClawMobile/ClawMobile} to facilitate future exploration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Implementations of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix-based neural networks for neural decoding remain fragmented across research codebases and Python packages. Existing implementations often employ ad hoc handling of manifold constraints and non-unified training setups, which hinders reproducibility and integration into modern deep-learning workflows. To address this gap, we introduce SPD Learn, a unified and modular Python package for geometric deep learning with SPD matrices. SPD Learn provides core SPD operators and neural-network layers, including numerically stable spectral operators, and enforces Stiefel/SPD constraints via trivialization-based parameterizations. This design enables standard backpropagation and optimization in unconstrained Euclidean spaces while producing manifold-constrained parameters by construction. The package also offers reference implementations of representative SPDNet-based models and interfaces with widely used brain computer interface/neuroimaging toolkits and modern machine-learning libraries (e.g., MOABB, Braindecode, Nilearn, and SKADA), facilitating reproducible benchmarking and practical deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for scalable reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{Compositional-ARC}\unicode{x2014}$a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of abstract two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a small transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions. Notably, despite having only 5.7M parameters, this model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs$\unicode{x2014}$including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior$\unicode{x2014}$and performs on par with the winning model of the ARC prize 2024, an 8B-parameter LLM trained via test-time training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Analysts in Security Operations Centers routinely query massive telemetry streams using Kusto Query Language (KQL). Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale. This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security. We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count. Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact. Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection. We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost. On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy. We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy. These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Argumentation mining comprises several subtasks, among which stance classification focuses on identifying the standpoint expressed in an argumentative text toward a specific target topic. While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34 distinct models across 45 configurations from major closed-source and open-source providers, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants. While some models, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, approximated human averages and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM outputs were consistently less diverse, with newer models and thinking-enabled modes often reducing rather than increasing variability. Network analysis further revealed fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and the most human-like model. Ensemble simulations combining outputs from diverse models also failed to recover human-level diversity, likely due to high vocabulary overlap across models. These results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.

To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy RL methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves 69.5% win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, demonstrating its potential for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy. To highlight VolleyBots' sim-to-real potential, we further demonstrate the zero-shot deployment of a policy trained entirely in simulation on real-world drones.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.
