                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present~\emph{KV-Tandem}, a modular architecture for building LSM-based storage engines on top of simple, non-ordered persistent key-value stores (KVSs). KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\%. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention concentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most layers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in training error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state drains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and performs better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid growth of LLMs has revolutionized natural language processing and AI analysis, but their increasing size and memory demands present significant challenges. A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput.   This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions.   Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.   The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.   We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.Codes are available at https://github.com/FYYFU/HeadKV

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation tasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated code generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has hindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common strategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV) states from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by mainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations, but brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use sparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or hallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the attention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical study, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at specific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach, AnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and compress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling cross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition caused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently achieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while preserving the majority of model's performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation learning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels for node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This makes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods typically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory and perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory consumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and maintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes of learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these prototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the cached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation Adaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype, reducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate. When a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant probabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back into the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the model's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of generalization error and explore the impact of different distillation strategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis. Compared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy and forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the https://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .

Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video-to-video synthesis poses significant challenges in maintaining character consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and preserving visual quality during fast motion. While recent fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they come with high computational costs and often include redundant operations, especially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies, we propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that selectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of cross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method leverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to stationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without increasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques struggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which compromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for jointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to preserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. With our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold increase in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all within the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines. This results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and alleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe. EcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique reduces operational costs and improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributes significantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximate self-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintaining the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research on the 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet b1.58, presents a promising direction for reducing the inference cost of LLMs while maintaining their performance. In this work, we introduce BitNet a4.8, enabling 4-bit activations for 1-bit LLMs. BitNet a4.8 employs a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to mitigate the quantization errors introduced by the outlier channels. Specifically, we utilize 4-bit activations for inputs to the attention and feed-forward network layers, while sparsifying intermediate states followed with 8-bit quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BitNet a4.8 achieves performance comparable to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs, while being faster in inference with enabling 4-bit (INT4/FP4) kernels. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 activates only 55% of parameters and supports 3-bit KV cache, further enhancing the efficiency of large-scale LLM deployment and inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in vision-language foundational models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated significant strides in zero-shot classification. However, the extensive parameterization of models like CLIP necessitates a resource-intensive fine-tuning process. In response, TIP-Adapter and SuS-X have introduced training-free methods aimed at bolstering the efficacy of downstream tasks. While these approaches incorporate support sets to maintain data distribution consistency between knowledge cache and test sets, they often fall short in terms of generalization on the test set, particularly when faced with test data exhibiting substantial distributional variations. In this work, we present CapS-Adapter, an innovative method that employs a caption-based support set, effectively harnessing both image and caption features to exceed existing state-of-the-art techniques in training-free scenarios. CapS-Adapter adeptly constructs support sets that closely mirror target distributions, utilizing instance-level distribution features extracted from multimodal large models. By leveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances predictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method achieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark datasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\% over the previous leading method. Our contributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust generalization capabilities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering enhanced capabilities with reduced inference costs. However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on memoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial memory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the memory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or compromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert offloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key insight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low precision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while preserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that map the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert loading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and (3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations fully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing HOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate its performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models. The results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding compared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.   We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrated micro power generators are crucial components for micro robotic platforms to demonstrate untethered operation and to achieve autonomy. Current micro robotic electrostatic actuators typically require hundreds to thousands of voltages to output sufficient work. Pyroelectricity is one such source of high voltages that can be scaled to small form factors. This paper demonstrates a distributed pyroelectric high voltage generation mechanism to power kV actuators using alternating exposure of crystals to hot and cold water (300C to 900C water temperature). Using this fluidic temperature control, a pyroelectrically generated voltage of 2470 V was delivered to a 2 pF storage capacitor yielding a 6.10 {\mu}J stored energy. A maximum energy of 17.46 {\mu}J was delivered to a 47 pF capacitor at 861 V. The recirculating water can be used to heat a distributed array of converters to generate electricity in distant robotic actuator sections. The development of this distributed system would enable untethered micro-robot to be operated with a flexible body and free of battery recharging, which advances its applications in the real world.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize performance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight process isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by allowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other co-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable for modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are insufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently, cloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation on commodity x86 machines.   This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables fine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing Intel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box offers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that sandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through compiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained access control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible data relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient isolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized TME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases geomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code and data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The room temperature continuous wave (CW) very-high-frequency (VHF) gun is one of the candidates for the electron gun of the high-repetition-rate free-electron lasers (FELs). The VHF gun operates with a cathode gradient of ~ 20 MV/m and an accelerating voltage of ~ 750 kV. The gun dark current emission leads to beam loss along the FEL machine, therefore is a critical parameter for the performance of the CW gun. In this paper, we presents a systematic study of the dark current reduction of the VHF gun, including cathode region optimizations, dark current tracking simulations and measurements. Over-inserted cathode plugs were tested in two VHF guns of different acceleration gap sizes, and both demonstrated significant dark current reduction ratios of more than two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Post-training KV-Cache compression methods typically either sample a subset of effectual tokens or quantize the data into lower numerical bit width. However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tensors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) optimized GPU kernels with operators fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89x on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91x speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods. These results demonstrate Palu's superior capability to effectively address the efficiency and memory challenges of LLM inference posed by KV-Cache.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. In this paper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which remain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI models with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to resource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of joint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a trade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical relationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by GenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into a model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation subproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete and continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The proposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the actor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently, we integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is studied through comparative numerical simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Modern applications demand high performance and cost efficient database management systems (DBMSs). Their workloads may be diverse, ranging from online transaction processing to analytics and decision support. The cloud infrastructure enables disaggregation of monolithic DBMSs into components that facilitate software-hardware co-design. This is realized using pools of hardware resources, i.e., CPUs, GPUs, memory, FPGA, NVM, etc., connected using high-speed networks. This disaggregation trend is being adopted by cloud DBMSs because hardware re-provisioning can be achieved by simply invoking software APIs. Disaggregated DBMSs separate processing from storage, enabling each to scale elastically and independently. They may disaggregate compute usage based on functionality, e.g., compute needed for writes from compute needed for queries and compute needed for compaction. They may also use disaggregated memory, e.g., for intermediate results in a shuffle or for remote caching. The DBMS monitors the characteristics of a workload and dynamically assembles its components that are most efficient and cost effective for the workload. This paper is a summary of a panel session that discussed the capability, challenges, and opportunities of these emerging DBMSs and disaggregated hardware systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a general purpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications with different access patterns, key-value sizes, and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMP is an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm that can be implemented as efficiently as LRU. In particular, CAMP's eviction policies are as effective as those of GDS but require only a small fraction of the updates to an internal data structure in order to make those decisions. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to changing workload patterns based on the history of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that requires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast as LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present results from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online LLM inference powers many exciting applications such as intelligent chatbots and autonomous agents. Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted.   We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of attention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU, effectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To this end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling to balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory resources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation, text summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B, 70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared to GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3% throughput gain on A10G GPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks associated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding step to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during batch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first token, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to prefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked by the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows linearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We design the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by incorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local architecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks to apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to capture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers, we apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model fine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and Block Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach 10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity and zero-shot task performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We describe a hidden surface removal algorithm for two-dimensional layered scenes built from arbitrary primitives, particularly suited to interaction and animation in rich scenes (for example, in illustration). The method makes use of a set-based raster representation to implement a front-to-back rendering model which analyses and dramatically reduces the amount of rasterization and composition required to render a scene. The method is extended to add frame-to-frame coherence analysis and caching for interactive or animated scenes. A powerful system of primitive-combiners called filters is described, which preserves the efficiencies of the algorithm in highly complicated scenes. The set representation is extended to solve the problem of correlated mattes, leading to an efficient solution for high quality antialiasing. A prototype implementation has been prepared.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a microservices architecture for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility and performance of an airline reservation system. The architectural design incorporates Redis cache technologies, two different messaging systems (Kafka and RabbitMQ), two types of storages (MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). It also introduces authorization techniques, including secure communication through OAuth2 and JWT which is essential with the management of high-demand travel services. According to selected indicators, the architecture provides an impressive level of data consistency at 99.5% and a latency of data propagation of less than 75 ms allowing rapid and reliable intercommunication between microservices. A system throughput of 1050 events per second was achieved so that the acceptability level was maintained even during peak time. Redis caching reduced a 92% cache hit ratio on the database thereby lowering the burden on the database and increasing the speed of response. Further improvement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and Kubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the changes in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the efficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach is suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It is secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well as the efficiency of operations. The low latency and high data integration levels and prevaiing efficient usage of the resources demonstrates the architecture ability to offer continued support in the ever growing high demand situations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In numerous production environments, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays an indispensable role, particularly when dealing with massive datasets that can contain billions of entries. The necessity for rapid response times in these applications makes the efficiency of ANNS algorithms crucial. However, traditional ANNS approaches encounter substantial challenges at the billion-scale level. CPU-based methods are hindered by the limitations of memory bandwidth, while GPU-based methods struggle with memory capacity and resource utilization efficiency. This paper introduces MemANNS, an innovative framework that utilizes UPMEM PIM architecture to address the memory bottlenecks in ANNS algorithms at scale. We concentrate on optimizing a well-known ANNS algorithm, IVFPQ, for PIM hardware through several techniques. First, we introduce an architecture-aware strategy for data placement and query scheduling that ensures an even distribution of workload across PIM chips, thereby maximizing the use of aggregated memory bandwidth. Additionally, we have developed an efficient thread scheduling mechanism that capitalizes on PIM's multi-threading capabilities and enhances memory management to boost cache efficiency. Moreover, we have recognized that real-world datasets often feature vectors with frequently co-occurring items. To address this, we propose a novel encoding method for IVFPQ that minimizes memory accesses during query processing. Our comprehensive evaluation using actual PIM hardware and real-world datasets at the billion-scale, show that MemANNS offers a significant 4.3x increase in QPS over CPU-based Faiss, and it matches the performance of GPU-based Faiss implementations. Additionally, MemANNS improves energy efficiency, with a 2.3x enhancement in QPS/Watt compared to GPU solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the contemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified by ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and maximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability of LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed by current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues and long job response times.   In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework, named ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel speculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and exploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus minimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we employ a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and quantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in comparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput of inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint on the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are essential in natural language processing but often struggle with inference speed and computational efficiency, limiting real-time deployment. The key-value (KV) cache mechanism reduces computational overhead in transformer models, but challenges in maintaining contextual understanding remain. In this paper, we propose BUZZ, a novel KV caching algorithm that leverages structured contextual information to minimize cache memory usage while enhancing inference speed. BUZZ employs a beehive-structured sparse cache, incorporating a sliding window to capture recent information and dynamically segmenting historical tokens into chunks to prioritize important tokens in local neighborhoods. We evaluate BUZZ on four real-world datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, XSUM, Wikitext, and 10-QA. Our results demonstrate that BUZZ (1) reduces cache memory usage by $\textbf{2.5}\times$ in LLM inference while maintaining over 99% accuracy in long-text summarization, and (2) surpasses state-of-the-art performance in multi-document question answering by $\textbf{7.69%}$ under the same memory limit, where full cache methods encounter out-of-memory issues. Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant inference speedup with a $\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at https://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Geomagnetically Induced Current (GIC) refers to the electromagnetic response of the Earth and its conductive modern infrastructures to space weather and would pose a significant threat to high-voltage power grids designed for the alternative current operation. To assess the impact of space weather on the power grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale. In this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm, Graph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a single-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and transmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its electric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and an admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to expedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The Graph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation of the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary analysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC algorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph representation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy calculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This algorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power grid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space weather modelling frameworks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints.   In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In large venues like shopping malls and airports, knowledge on the indoor populations fuels applications such as business analytics, venue management, and safety control. In this work, we provide means of modeling populations in partitions of indoor space offline and of monitoring indoor populations continuously, by using indoor positioning data. However, the low-sampling rates of indoor positioning render the data temporally and spatially sparse, which in turn renders the offline capture of indoor populations challenging. It is even more challenging to continuously monitor indoor populations, as positioning data may be missing or not ready yet at the current moment. To address these challenges, we first enable probabilistic modeling of populations in indoor space partitions as Normal distributions. Based on that, we propose two learning-based estimators for on-the-fly prediction of population distributions. Leveraging the prediction-based schemes, we provide a unified continuous query processing framework for a type of query that enables continuous monitoring of populated partitions. The framework encompasses caching and result validity mechanisms to reduce cost and maintain monitoring effectiveness. Extensive experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed estimators are able to outperform the state-of-the-art alternatives and that the query processing framework is effective and efficient.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The promising applications of large language models are often constrained by the limited GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help mitigate this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation, allowing the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory and reducing overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively and significantly impact system performance. In this paper, we propose ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that leverages intermediate model results to predict subsequent parameter usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE removes the loading time from the critical path and diminishes the performance overhead of offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.13x and 2.84x in the prefill and decode stages respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The context window of large language models (LLMs) is rapidly increasing, leading to a huge variance in resource usage between different requests as well as between different phases of the same request. Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the greedy policy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> `In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative large language models (LLMs), which create text without direct correspondence to truth value, are widely understood to resemble the uses of language described in Frankfurt's popular monograph On Bullshit. In this paper, we offer a rigorous investigation of this topic, identifying how the phenomenon has arisen, and how it might be analysed. In this paper, we elaborate on this argument to propose that LLM-based chatbots play the 'language game of bullshit'. We use statistical text analysis to investigate the features of this Wittgensteinian language game, based on a dataset constructed to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical pseudo-scientific text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of politics and language, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of the language of bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> JWST has revealed a large population of compact, red galaxies at $z>4$ known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 95 LRDs from the JWST PRIMER survey with complete photometric coverage from $1-18\ \mu$m using NIRCam and MIRI imaging, representing the most extensive SED analysis on a large LRD sample with long-wavelength MIRI data. We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario's implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning $\sim$2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN or galaxy dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.

Despite the abundance of object detection schemes, real-time DETR models are shown to perform significantly better on inference times, with minimal loss of accuracy and performance. In our work, we used Real-Time DETR (RTDETR) object detection on the BadODD Road Object Detection dataset based in Bangladesh, and performed necessary experimentation and testing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion-based imitation learning improves Behavioral Cloning (BC) on multi-modal decision-making, but comes at the cost of significantly slower inference due to the recursion in the diffusion process. It urges us to design efficient policy generators while keeping the ability to generate diverse actions. To address this challenge, we propose AdaFlow, an imitation learning framework based on flow-based generative modeling. AdaFlow represents the policy with state-conditioned ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are known as probability flows. We reveal an intriguing connection between the conditional variance of their training loss and the discretization error of the ODEs. With this insight, we propose a variance-adaptive ODE solver that can adjust its step size in the inference stage, making AdaFlow an adaptive decision-maker, offering rapid inference without sacrificing diversity. Interestingly, it automatically reduces to a one-step generator when the action distribution is uni-modal. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation shows that AdaFlow achieves high performance with fast inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> From 2020 to 2023, Major League Baseball changed rules affecting team composition, player positioning, and game time. Understanding the effects of these rules is crucial for leagues, teams, players, and other relevant parties to assess their impact and to advocate either for further changes or undoing previous ones. Panel data and quasi-experimental methods provide useful tools for causal inference in these settings. I demonstrate this potential by analyzing the effect of the 2023 shift ban at both the league-wide and player-specific levels. Using difference-in-differences analysis, I show that the policy increased batting average on balls in play and on-base percentage for left-handed batters by a modest amount (nine points). For individual players, synthetic control analyses identify several players whose offensive performance (on-base percentage, on-base plus slugging percentage, and weighted on-base average) improved substantially (over 70 points in several cases) because of the rule change, and other players with previously high shift rates for whom it had little effect. This article both estimates the impact of this specific rule change and demonstrates how these methods for causal inference are potentially valuable for sports analytics -- at the player, team, and league levels -- more broadly.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Point cloud completion aims to infer a complete shape from its partial observation. Many approaches utilize a pure encoderdecoder paradigm in which complete shape can be directly predicted by shape priors learned from partial scans, however, these methods suffer from the loss of details inevitably due to the feature abstraction issues. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,termed SPAC-Net, that aims to rethink the completion task under the guidance of a new structural prior, we call it interface. Specifically, our method first investigates Marginal Detector (MAD) module to localize the interface, defined as the intersection between the known observation and the missing parts. Based on the interface, our method predicts the coarse shape by learning the displacement from the points in interface move to their corresponding position in missing parts. Furthermore, we devise an additional Structure Supplement(SSP) module before the upsampling stage to enhance the structural details of the coarse shape, enabling the upsampling module to focus more on the upsampling task. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several challenging benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models LLMs like ChatGPT have reached the 100 Mio user barrier in record time and might increasingly enter all areas of our life leading to a diverse set of interactions between those Artificial Intelligence models and humans. While many studies have discussed governance and regulations deductively from first-order principles, few studies provide an inductive, data-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs especially when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have the potential to pose a serious threat to people. In this work, we conduct a user study engaging over 40 individuals across all age groups in price negotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM, investigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities and, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the LLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any rationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve span a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting with LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In multi-agent systems, the agent behavior is highly influenced by its utility function, as these utilities shape both individual goals as well as interactions with the other agents. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a well-established approach to inferring the utility function by observing an expert behavior within a given environment. In this paper, we extend the IRL framework to the multi-agent setting, assuming to observe agents who are following Nash Equilibrium (NE) policies. We theoretically investigate the set of utilities that explain the behavior of NE experts. Specifically, we provide an explicit characterization of the feasible reward set and analyze how errors in estimating the transition dynamics and expert behavior impact the recovered rewards. Building on these findings, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the multi-agent IRL problem. Finally, we provide a numerical evaluation of our theoretical results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike the existing methods, our proposed approach eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed methodology to the settings, in which the treatment feature is based on human perception rather than is assumed to be fixed given the treatment object. The proposed methodology is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate the existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama 3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over the state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit demographic biases, yet few studies systematically evaluate these biases across multiple datasets or account for confounding factors. In this work, we examine LLM alignment with human annotations in five offensive language datasets, comprising approximately 220K annotations. Our findings reveal that while demographic traits, particularly race, influence alignment, these effects are inconsistent across datasets and often entangled with other factors. Confounders -- such as document difficulty, annotator sensitivity, and within-group agreement -- account for more variation in alignment patterns than demographic traits alone. Specifically, alignment increases with higher annotator sensitivity and group agreement, while greater document difficulty corresponds to reduced alignment. Our results underscore the importance of multi-dataset analyses and confounder-aware methodologies in developing robust measures of demographic bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks. Using a dataset of previous experience is possible to provide detailed feedback about the failure. Updating the LLMs context of the next iteration with suggestion on how to overcame the issue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robots are increasingly being used in dynamic environments like workplaces, hospitals, and homes. As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero Trust (ZT) is a security paradigm aiming to curtail an attacker's lateral movements within a network by implementing least-privilege and per-request access control policies. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the difficulty of generating proper rules due to the lack of detailed knowledge of communication requirements and the characteristic behaviors of communicating entities under benign conditions. Consequently, manual rule generation becomes cumbersome and error-prone. To address these problems, we propose ZT-SDN, an automated framework for learning and enforcing network access control in Software-Defined Networks. ZT-SDN collects data from the underlying network and models the network "transactions" performed by communicating entities as graphs. The nodes represent entities, while the directed edges represent transactions identified by different protocol stacks observed. It uses novel unsupervised learning approaches to extract transaction patterns directly from the network data, such as the allowed protocol stacks and port numbers and data transmission behavior. Finally, ZT-SDN uses an innovative approach to generate correct access control rules and infer strong associations between them, allowing proactive rule deployment in forwarding devices. We show the framework's efficacy in detecting abnormal network accesses and abuses of permitted flows in changing network conditions with real network datasets. Additionally, we showcase ZT-SDN's scalability and the network's performance when applied in an SDN environment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. Our method's qualitative and quantitative improvements over 3D and 2D Gaussians are most noticeable when fewer primitives are used, when BBSplat achieves over 1200 FPS. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360. We demonstrate improvements on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to the state-of-the-art, especially for the case when fewer primitives are used, which, on the other hand, leads to up to 2 times inference speed improvement for the same rendering quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The study of starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is crucial for understanding the regulation of star formation and the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Arp 220, the closest ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), is in an advanced phase of a major merger with two distinct nuclei, and it shows evidence of multiphase and multiscale (from < 0.1 to > 5 kpc) outflows. Therefore, it represents an ideal system for investigating outflow mechanisms and feedback phenomena in detail. Using new JWST NIRSpec IFU observations, we investigated the spatially resolved gaseous (in both ionized and hot molecular phases) and stellar kinematics in the innermost 1 kpc. We decoupled the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting, identifying two multiphase outflows, each associated with one nucleus, with velocities up to $\sim 1000$km/s. We also resolved two counter-rotating discs around each nucleus embedded in a larger-scale rotational disk. We compute the total outflow mass ($\approx 10^7$M$_\odot$), the mass rate ($\sim 15$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), and the energetics ($\dot E_{out}\approx 10^{42}$erg/s) for each nucleus, and we found that the ionized and hot molecular outflowing gas contribute around 2-30% of the total mass and the energy of the outflows, as inferred from the combination of multiwavelength information. We discuss the possible origin of the outflows, finding no compelling evidence to prefer a starburst- or AGN-driven scenario. Regardless of their nature, outflows in Arp~220 propagate in multiple directions from parsec to kiloparsec scales, potentially impacting a significant portion of the host galaxy. This contrasts with isolated systems where outflows typically follow a more collimated path or are limited to the central region of the galaxy and hence do not affect the interstellar medium throughout the entire galaxy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly improving to handle increasingly complex web-based tasks. Most of these agents rely on general-purpose, proprietary models like GPT-4 and focus on designing better prompts to improve their planning abilities. However, general-purpose LLMs are not specifically trained to understand specialized web contexts such as HTML, and they often struggle with long-horizon planning. We explore an alternative approach that fine-tunes open-source LLMs using production-scale workflow data collected from over 250 domains corresponding to 6 billion tokens. This simple yet effective approach shows substantial gains over prompting-based agents on existing benchmarks -- ScribeAgent achieves state-of-the-art direct generation performance on Mind2Web and improves the task success rate by 14.1% over the previous best text-only web agents on WebArena. We further perform detailed ablation studies on various fine-tuning design choices and provide insights into LLM selection, training recipes, context window optimization, and effect of dataset sizes.

Utilizing gpt-4o-mini, a cost-effective alternative to larger commercial LLMs, three methods, Word+Review, Review+Word, and Supply-Word, were each used to synthesize 1000 product reviews. The generated datasets were assessed for sentiment alignment, textual diversity, and data generation cost. Results demonstrated high sentiment alignment across all methods, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Supply-Word exhibited the highest diversity and coverage of PDT terms, although with increased generation costs. Despite minor biases toward positive sentiments, in situations with limited test data, LLM-generated synthetic data offers significant advantages, including scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in dataset production.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robotic manipulation of volumetric elastoplastic deformable materials, from foods such as dough to construction materials like clay, is in its infancy, largely due to the difficulty of modelling and perception in a high-dimensional space. Simulating the dynamics of such materials is computationally expensive. It tends to suffer from inaccurately estimated physics parameters of the materials and the environment, impeding high-precision manipulation. Estimating such parameters from raw point clouds captured by optical cameras suffers further from heavy occlusions. To address this challenge, this work introduces a novel Differentiable Physics-based System Identification (DPSI) framework that enables a robot arm to infer the physics parameters of elastoplastic materials and the environment using simple manipulation motions and incomplete 3D point clouds, aligning the simulation with the real world. Extensive experiments show that with only a single real-world interaction, the estimated parameters, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress and friction coefficients, can accurately simulate visually and physically realistic deformation behaviours induced by unseen and long-horizon manipulation motions. Additionally, the DPSI framework inherently provides physically intuitive interpretations for the parameters in contrast to black-box approaches such as deep neural networks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> TIPO (Text to Image with text pre-sampling for Prompt Optimization) is an innovative framework designed to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by language model (LM) for automatic prompt engineering. By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> [Abridged] Binary black holes may form and merge dynamically. These binaries are likely to become bound with high eccentricities, resulting in a burst of gravitational radiation at their point of closest approach. When such a binary is perturbed by a third body, the evolution of the orbit is affected, and gravitational-wave burst times are altered. The bursts times therefore encode information about the tertiary. In order to extract this information, we require a prescription for the relationship between the tertiary properties and the gravitational-wave burst times. In this paper, we demonstrate a toy model for the burst times of a secular three-body system. We show how Bayesian inference can be employed to deduce the tertiary properties when the bursts are detected by next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We study the bursts from an eccentric binary with a total mass of $60$~M$_\odot$ orbiting an $6 \times 10^{8}$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole. When we assume no knowledge of the eccentric binary, we are unable to tightly constrain the existence or properties of the tertiary, and we recover biased posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the eccentric binary. However, when the properties of the binary are already well-known -- as is likely if the late inspiral and merger are also detected -- we are able to more accurately infer the mass of the perturber, $m_3$, and its distance from the binary, $R$. When we assume measurement precision on the binary parameters consistent with expectations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, we can be greater than $90\%$ confident that the binary is perturbed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online hate speech poses a serious threat to individual well-being and societal cohesion. A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech. However, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and may even backfire.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Piecewise deterministic Markov processes provide scalable methods for sampling from the posterior distributions in big data settings by admitting principled sub-sampling strategies that do not bias the output. An important example is the Zig-Zag process of [Ann. Stats. 47 (2019) 1288 - 1320] where clever sub-sampling has been shown to produce an essentially independent sample at a cost that does not scale with the size of the data. However, sub-sampling also leads to slower convergence and poor mixing of the process, a behaviour which questions the promised scalability of the algorithm. We provide a large sample scaling analysis of the Zig-Zag process and its sub-sampling versions in settings of parametric Bayesian inference. In the transient phase of the algorithm, we show that the Zig-Zag trajectories are well approximated by the solution to a system of ODEs. These ODEs possess a drift in the direction of decreasing KL-divergence between the assumed model and the true distribution and are explicitly characterized in the paper. In the stationary phase, we give weak convergence results for different versions of the Zig-Zag process. Based on our results, we estimate that for large data sets of size n, using suitable control variates with sub-sampling in Zig-Zag, the algorithm costs O(1) to obtain an essentially independent sample; a computational speed-up of O(n) over the canonical version of Zig-Zag and other traditional MCMC methods

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of the large language model~(LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing Wafer-Scale Chips~(WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads.   Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8\%/73.7\% in performance and 38.6\%/42.4\% in power consumption for LLM training, while improving up to 23.2$\times$ and 15.7$\times$ for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Legacy software systems, written in outdated languages like MUMPS and mainframe assembly, pose challenges in efficiency, maintenance, staffing, and security. While LLMs offer promise for modernizing these systems, their ability to understand legacy languages is largely unknown. This paper investigates the utilization of LLMs to generate documentation for legacy code using two datasets: an electronic health records (EHR) system in MUMPS and open-source applications in IBM mainframe Assembly Language Code (ALC). We propose a prompting strategy for generating line-wise code comments and a rubric to evaluate their completeness, readability, usefulness, and hallucination. Our study assesses the correlation between human evaluations and automated metrics, such as code complexity and reference-based metrics. We find that LLM-generated comments for MUMPS and ALC are generally hallucination-free, complete, readable, and useful compared to ground-truth comments, though ALC poses challenges. However, no automated metrics strongly correlate with comment quality to predict or measure LLM performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of current automated measures and the need for better evaluation metrics for LLM-generated documentation in legacy systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Audio description (AD) is a crucial accessibility service provided to blind persons and persons with visual impairment, designed to convey visual information in acoustic form. Despite recent advancements in multilingual machine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD data impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems that address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland. Furthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty exists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding video clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present SwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and English. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in German, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse language populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to the desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of both automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising capability of SwissADT for the ADT task. We believe that combining human expertise with the generation power of LLMs can further enhance the performance of ADT systems, ultimately benefiting a larger multilingual target population.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate barcode detection and decoding in Identity documents is crucial for applications like security, healthcare, and education, where reliable data extraction and verification are essential. However, building robust detection models is challenging due to the lack of diverse, realistic datasets an issue often tied to privacy concerns and the wide variety of document formats. Traditional tools like Faker rely on predefined templates, making them less effective for capturing the complexity of real-world identity documents. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to synthetic data generation that uses LLMs to create contextually rich and realistic data without relying on predefined field. Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents and content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real identity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on templates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student IDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields. Compared to traditional methods like Faker, data generated by LLM demonstrates greater diversity and contextual relevance, leading to improved performance in barcode detection models. This scalable, privacy-first solution is a big step forward in advancing machine learning for automated document processing and identity verification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graphic designs are an effective medium for visual communication. They range from greeting cards to corporate flyers and beyond. Off-late, machine learning techniques are able to generate such designs, which accelerates the rate of content production. An automated way of evaluating their quality becomes critical. Towards this end, we introduce Design-o-meter, a data-driven methodology to quantify the goodness of graphic designs. Further, our approach can suggest modifications to these designs to improve its visual appeal. To the best of our knowledge, Design-o-meter is the first approach that scores and refines designs in a unified framework despite the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of the setting. Our exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach against baselines adapted for the task (including recent Multimodal LLM-based approaches) brings out the efficacy of our methodology. We hope our work will usher more interest in this important and pragmatic problem setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One of the most promising use-cases for machine learning in industrial manufacturing is the early detection of defective products using a quality control system. Such a system can save costs and reduces human errors due to the monotonous nature of visual inspections. Today, a rich body of research exists which employs machine learning methods to identify rare defective products in unbalanced visual quality control datasets. These methods typically rely on two components: A visual backbone to capture the features of the input image and an anomaly detection algorithm that decides if these features are within an expected distribution. With the rise of transformer architecture as visual backbones of choice, there exists now a great variety of different combinations of these two components, ranging all along the trade-off between detection quality and inference time. Facing this variety, practitioners in the field often have to spend a considerable amount of time on researching the right combination for their use-case at hand. Our contribution is to help practitioners with this choice by reviewing and evaluating current vision transformer models together with anomaly detection methods. For this, we chose SotA models of both disciplines, combined them and evaluated them towards the goal of having small, fast and efficient anomaly detection models suitable for industrial manufacturing. We evaluated the results of our experiments on the well-known MVTecAD and BTAD datasets. Moreover, we give guidelines for choosing a suitable model architecture for a quality control system in practice, considering given use-case and hardware constraints.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks requiring processing and interpretation of input text. Abstract screening is a labour-intensive component of systematic review involving repetitive application of inclusion and exclusion criteria on a large volume of studies identified by a literature search. Here, LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 3.5) were trialled on systematic reviews in a full issue of the Cochrane Library to evaluate their accuracy in zero-shot binary classification for abstract screening. Trials over a subset of 800 records identified optimal prompting strategies and demonstrated superior performance of LLMs to human researchers in terms of sensitivity (LLM-max = 1.000, human-max = 0.775), precision (LLM-max = 0.927, human-max = 0.911), and balanced accuracy (LLM-max = 0.904, human-max = 0.865). The best performing LLM-prompt combinations were trialled across every replicated search result (n = 119,691), and exhibited consistent sensitivity (range 0.756-1.000) but diminished precision (range 0.004-0.096). 66 LLM-human and LLM-LLM ensembles exhibited perfect sensitivity with a maximal precision of 0.458, with less observed performance drop in larger trials. Significant variation in performance was observed between reviews, highlighting the importance of domain-specific validation before deployment. LLMs may reduce the human labour cost of systematic review with maintained or improved accuracy and sensitivity. Systematic review is the foundation of evidence synthesis across academic disciplines, including evidence-based medicine, and LLMs may increase the efficiency and quality of this mode of research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The interplay between atomic gas, the star-formation history of a galaxy and its environment are intrinsically linked, and we need to decouple these dependencies to understand their role in galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper, we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of 187 galaxies from the MIGHTEE-HI Survey Early Science Release data, focusing on the relationships between HI properties and star formation. A strong correlation emerges between a galaxy's HI-to-stellar mass ratio and the time of formation, alongside an inverse correlation between stellar mass and time of formation, regardless of the inferred SFH. Additionally, galaxies with lower stellar masses and higher HI-to-stellar mass ratios exhibit longer gas depletion times compared to more massive galaxies, which appear to have depleted their gas and formed stars more efficiently. This suggests that smaller, gas-rich galaxies have higher depletion times due to shallower potential wells and less efficient star formation. Furthermore, we explore the connection between spin-filament alignment and HI content. We find no significant correlation between peak star formation activity and proximity to filaments. However, we do find that the two galaxies in our sample within 1 Mpc of a filament have very low gas-depletion timescales and have their spin axis misaligned with the filament, suggestive of a link between the galaxy properties and proximity to a filament.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4751. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has made apparent the need for decision support based upon accurate epidemic modeling. This process is substantially hampered by under-reporting of cases and related data incompleteness issues. In this article we adopt the Bayesian paradigm and synthesize publicly available data via a discrete-time stochastic epidemic modeling framework. The models allow for estimating the total number of infections while accounting for the endemic phase of the pandemic. We assess the prediction of the infection rate utilizing mobility information, notably the principal components of the mobility data. We evaluate variational Bayes in this context and find that Hamiltonian Monte Carlo offers a robust inference alternative for such models. We elaborate upon vector analysis of the epidemic dynamics, thus enriching the traditional tools used for decision making. In particular, we show how certain 2-dimensional plots on the phase plane may yield intuitive information regarding the speed and the type of transmission dynamics. We investigate the potential of a two-stage analysis as a consequence of cutting feedback, for inference on certain functionals of the model parameters. Finally, we show that a point mass on critical parameters is overly restrictive and investigate informative priors as a suitable alternative.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored various methods to optimally leverage their comprehension and generation capabilities in sequential recommendation scenarios. However, several challenges persist in this endeavor. Firstly, most existing approaches rely on the input-output prompting paradigm, which can result in irrelevant or inaccurate responses. Secondly, while there have been attempts to enhance LLMs using prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought (CoT), these efforts have not fully harnessed the reasoning abilities of LLMs or effectively captured the multifaceted information contained within user sequences. To address these limitations, we propose GOT4Rec, a sequential recommendation method that utilizes the graph of thoughts (GoT) prompting strategy. Specifically, we identify and utilize three key types of information within user history sequences: short-term interests, long-term interests and collaborative information from other users. Our approach enables LLMs to independently reason and generate recommendations based on these distinct types of information, subsequently aggregating the results within the GoT framework to derive the final recommended items. This method allows LLMs, with enhanced reasoning capabilities, to more effectively consider the diverse information within user sequences, resulting in more accurate recommendations and more comprehensive explanations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GOT4Rec, indicating that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Task-aware robotic grasping is a challenging problem that requires the integration of semantic understanding and geometric reasoning. Traditional grasp planning approaches focus on stable or feasible grasps, often disregarding the specific tasks the robot needs to accomplish. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to enable zero-shot task-conditioned grasp selection. The framework segments objects into meaningful subparts and labels each subpart semantically, creating structured representations that can be used to prompt an LLM. By coupling semantic and geometric representations of an object's structure, the LLM's knowledge about tasks and which parts to grasp can be applied in the physical world. The QD-generated grasp archive provides a diverse set of grasps, allowing us to select the most suitable grasp based on the task. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the YCB dataset, where a Franka Emika robot is assigned to perform various actions based on object-specific task requirements. We created a ground truth by conducting a survey with six participants to determine the best grasp region for each task-object combination according to human intuition. The model was evaluated on 12 different objects across 4--7 object-specific tasks, achieving a weighted intersection over union (IoU) of 76.4% when compared to the survey data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research, yet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed literature curation process. The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers in several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean queries that will select the publications to consider including in a review. This paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs for systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and Alaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of results achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source alternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis of LLMs for query generation.   Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean query for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all documents for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the results. With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using ChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then generalize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and evaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.   Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the limitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation. This examination helps to understand the gaps and potential areas for improvement in the application of LLMs to information retrieval tasks. Our findings highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential of LLMs in the domain of information retrieval and literature review automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Learning diverse policies for non-prehensile manipulation is essential for improving skill transfer and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we enhance exploration through a two-fold approach within a hybrid framework that tackles both discrete and continuous action spaces. First, we model the continuous motion parameter policy as a diffusion model, and second, we incorporate this into a maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework that unifies both the discrete and continuous components. The discrete action space, such as contact point selection, is optimized through Q-value function maximization, while the continuous part is guided by a diffusion-based policy. This hybrid approach leads to a principled objective, where the maximum entropy term is derived as a lower bound using structured variational inference. We propose the Hybrid Diffusion Policy algorithm (HyDo) and evaluate its performance on both simulation and zero-shot sim2real tasks. Our results show that HyDo encourages more diverse behavior policies, leading to significantly improved success rates across tasks - for example, increasing from 53% to 72% on a real-world 6D pose alignment task.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?   To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement.   Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.   The code used for the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDCG/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more advanced and widespread and have shown their applicability to various domains, including cybersecurity. Static malware analysis is one of the most important tasks in cybersecurity; however, it is time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, we conducted a demonstration experiment focusing on whether an LLM can be used to support static analysis. First, we evaluated the ability of the LLM to explain malware functionality. The results showed that the LLM can generate descriptions that cover functions with an accuracy of up to 90.9\%. In addition, we asked six static analysts to perform a pseudo static analysis task using LLM explanations to verify that the LLM can be used in practice. Through subsequent questionnaires and interviews with the participants, we also demonstrated the practical applicability of LLMs. Lastly, we summarized the problems and required functions when using an LLM as static analysis support, as well as recommendations for future research opportunities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Planning for a wide range of real-world tasks necessitates to know and write all constraints. However, instances exist where these constraints are either unknown or challenging to specify accurately. A possible solution is to infer the unknown constraints from expert demonstration. The majority of prior works limit themselves to learning simple linear constraints, or require strong knowledge of the true constraint parameterization or environmental model. To mitigate these problems, this paper presents a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning approach to infer a continuous, arbitrary and possibly nonlinear, constraint from demonstration. From a PU learning view, We treat all data in demonstrations as positive (feasible) data, and learn a (sub)-optimal policy to generate high-reward-winning but potentially infeasible trajectories, which serve as unlabeled data containing both feasible and infeasible states. Under an assumption on data distribution, a feasible-infeasible classifier (i.e., constraint model) is learned from the two datasets through a postprocessing PU learning technique. The entire method employs an iterative framework alternating between updating the policy, which generates and selects higher-reward policies, and updating the constraint model. Additionally, a memory buffer is introduced to record and reuse samples from previous iterations to prevent forgetting. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two Mujoco environments, successfully inferring continuous nonlinear constraints and outperforming a baseline method in terms of constraint accuracy and policy safety.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel at retrieving information from lengthy text, but their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) face difficulties with hour-long videos, especially for temporal grounding. Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD).

Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction-based LLMs can be effectively utilized for data augmentation to generate diverse and realistic text samples. This study applied prompt-based data augmentation to detect mentions of green practices in Russian social media. Detecting green practices in social media aids in understanding their prevalence and helps formulate recommendations for scaling eco-friendly actions to mitigate environmental issues. We evaluated several prompts for augmenting texts in a multi-label classification task, either by rewriting existing datasets using LLMs, generating new data, or combining both approaches. Our results revealed that all strategies improved classification performance compared to the models fine-tuned only on the original dataset, outperforming baselines in most cases. The best results were obtained with the prompt that paraphrased the original text while clearly indicating the relevant categories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gender bias in text corpora that are used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as for training large language models (LLMs), can lead to the perpetuation and amplification of societal inequalities. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in gendered languages like Spanish or French, where grammatical structures inherently encode gender, making the bias analysis more challenging. A first step in quantifying gender bias in text entails computing biases in gender representation, i.e., differences in the prevalence of words referring to males vs. females. Existing methods to measure gender representation bias in text corpora have mainly been proposed for English and do not generalize to gendered languages due to the intrinsic linguistic differences between English and gendered languages. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to quantitatively measure gender representation bias in Spanish corpora. By utilizing LLMs to identify and classify gendered nouns and pronouns in relation to their reference to human entities, our approach provides a robust analysis of gender representation bias in gendered languages. We empirically validate our method on four widely-used benchmark datasets, uncovering significant gender prevalence disparities with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 4:1 to 6:1. These findings demonstrate the value of our methodology for bias quantification in gendered language corpora and suggest its application in NLP, contributing to the development of more equitable language technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making alignment methods for these models increasingly important. A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational agents are increasingly used in healthcare, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their capabilities. When integrated into social robots, LLMs offer the potential for more natural interactions. However, while LLMs promise numerous benefits, they also raise critical ethical concerns, particularly around the issue of hallucinations and deceptive patterns. In this case study, we observed a critical pattern of deceptive behavior in commercially available LLM-based care software integrated into robots. The LLM-equipped robot falsely claimed to have medication reminder functionalities. Not only did these systems assure users of their ability to manage medication schedules, but they also proactively suggested this capability, despite lacking it. This deceptive behavior poses significant risks in healthcare environments, where reliability is paramount. Our findings highlights the ethical and safety concerns surrounding the deployment of LLM-integrated robots in healthcare, emphasizing the need for oversight to prevent potentially harmful consequences for vulnerable populations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models (DMs), which enable both image generation from noise and inversion from data, have inspired powerful unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation algorithms. However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. In pursuit of performance closer to full-parameter training, a series of LoRA variants have emerged, such as LoRA+, PISSA, Olora, and LoRA-GA. This paper introduces a novel PEFT technique distinct from LoRA, called Block-Affine Adaptation (Bone). By dividing the original weights into multiple subspaces that share a single matrix for weight updates, Bone simplifies the process by requiring the trainable matrix to be initialized to zero, eliminating the need for complex initialization as in some LoRA variants. Compared to LoRA, Bone significantly reduces memory usage and achieves faster computation. Evaluation of both NLU and NLG tasks demonstrates that Bone substantially outperforms LoRA and its variants. Inspired by Pissa, we further proposed the ``Weight Guide'' theory to better utilize the information from the original weights. By integrating ``Weight Guide'' with Bone, we developed a new structure called Block-Affine Transformation (Bat), and ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of ``Weight Guide''.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization ability to novel views. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem, presenting a Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. Our method encompasses a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model. The $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model serves as an ensemble of 3DGS models that generates novel-view images during inference. We achieve the self-ensembling by introducing an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy at the training state. We complement the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model with the $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model, which is dynamically perturbed based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps. The perturbation yields diverse temporal samples in the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of 3DGS models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model. Our experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research has primarily focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the the vulnerabilities of LLMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others, using three distinct evaluation methods on the CAA benchmark. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the impact of four types of audio attacks on the performance of these models, demonstrating that GPT-4o exhibits the highest level of resilience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cellular activities are dynamic and intricate, playing a crucial role in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, yet they often require substantial resources for accurate tracking. Despite recent progress, the conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches not only heavily rely on detection or segmentation results as a prerequisite for the tracking stage, demanding plenty of refined segmentation masks, but are also deteriorated by imbalanced and long sequence data, leading to under-learning in training and missing cells in inference procedures. To alleviate the above issues, this paper proposes the novel end-to-end CAP framework, which leverages the idea of regarding Cell as Point to achieve efficient and stable cell tracking in one stage. CAP abandons detection or segmentation stages and simplifies the process by exploiting the correlation among the trajectories of cell points to track cells jointly, thus reducing the label demand and complexity of the pipeline. With cell point trajectory and visibility to represent cell locations and lineage relationships, CAP leverages the key innovations of adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling for addressing data imbalance in cell division events and the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference method to ensure continuous tracking of new cells in the long term. Eliminating the need for a prerequisite detection or segmentation stage, CAP demonstrates strong cell tracking performance while also being 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and models will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current cybersecurity landscape is increasingly complex, with traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools struggling to capture complex and emerging vulnerabilities due to their reliance on rule-based matching. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful code analysis capabilities, but their static training data and privacy risks limit their effectiveness. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose LSAST, a novel approach that integrates LLMs with SAST scanners to enhance vulnerability detection. LSAST leverages a locally hostable LLM, combined with a state-of-the-art knowledge retrieval system, to provide up-to-date vulnerability insights without compromising data privacy. We set a new benchmark for static vulnerability analysis, offering a robust, privacy-conscious solution that bridges the gap between traditional scanners and advanced AI-driven analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that incorporating SAST results into LLM analysis significantly improves detection accuracy, identifying vulnerabilities missed by conventional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) showcase unprecedented capabilities, they also exhibit certain inherent limitations when facing seemingly trivial tasks. A prime example is the recently debated "reversal curse", which surfaces when models, having been trained on the fact "A is B", struggle to generalize this knowledge to infer that "B is A". In this paper, we examine the manifestation of the reversal curse across various tasks and delve into both the generalization abilities and the problem-solving mechanisms of LLMs. This investigation leads to a series of significant insights: (1) LLMs are able to generalize to "B is A" when both A and B are presented in the context as in the case of a multiple-choice question. (2) This generalization ability is highly correlated to the structure of the fact "A is B" in the training documents. For example, this generalization only applies to biographies structured in "[Name] is [Description]" but not to "[Description] is [Name]". (3) We propose and verify the hypothesis that LLMs possess an inherent bias in fact recalling during knowledge application, which explains and underscores the importance of the document structure to successful learning. (4) The negative impact of this bias on the downstream performance of LLMs can hardly be mitigated through training alone. These findings offer a novel perspective on interpreting LLMs' generalization through their intrinsic mechanisms and provide insights for developing more effective learning methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce Xmodel-1.5, a 1-billion-parameter multilingual large language model pretrained on 2 trillion tokens, designed for balanced performance and scalability. Unlike most large models that use the BPE tokenizer, Xmodel-1.5 employs a custom unigram tokenizer with 65,280 tokens, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. The model delivers competitive results across multiple languages, including Thai, Arabic, French, Chinese, and English, outperforming Alibaba's PolyLM-1.7B on respective evaluation datasets. Xmodel-1.5 excels in benchmarks like mMMLU and PIQA, and achieves state-of-the-art results in Thai. To support low-resource language research, we release Xdata_Thai, a Thai-specific evaluation dataset featuring unique linguistic challenges such as gendered particles and idioms. While the model demonstrates strong performance, there is still room for improvement in handling culturally specific nuances. We hope this work contributes to advancements in multilingual AI research. Models and code are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/XmodelLM-1.5

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Current passive deepfake face-swapping detection methods encounter significance bottlenecks in model generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, proactive detection methods often use fixed watermarks which lack a close relationship with the content they protect and are vulnerable to security risks. Dynamic watermarks based on facial features offer a promising solution, as these features provide unique identifiers. Therefore, this paper proposes a Facial Feature-based Proactive deepfake detection method (FaceProtect), which utilizes changes in facial characteristics during deepfake manipulation as a novel detection mechanism. We introduce a GAN-based One-way Dynamic Watermark Generating Mechanism (GODWGM) that uses 128-dimensional facial feature vectors as inputs. This method creates irreversible mappings from facial features to watermarks, enhancing protection against various reverse inference attacks. Additionally, we propose a Watermark-based Verification Strategy (WVS) that combines steganography with GODWGM, allowing simultaneous transmission of the benchmark watermark representing facial features within the image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method maintains exceptional detection performance and exhibits high practicality on images altered by various deepfake techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Estimating and obtaining reliable inference for the marginally adjusted causal dose-response curve for continuous treatments without relying on parametric assumptions is a well-known statistical challenge. Parametric models risk introducing significant bias through model misspecification, compromising the accurate representation of the underlying data and dose-response relationship. On the other hand, nonparametric models face difficulties as the dose-response curve is not pathwise differentiable, preventing consistent estimation at standard rates. The Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) maximum likelihood estimator offers a promising approach to this issue. In this paper, we introduce a HAL-based plug-in estimator for the causal dose-response curve and assess its empirical performance against other estimators. Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of the estimation and the quality of the inference, particularly in terms of coverage, using robust standard error estimators. Our results demonstrate the finite-sample effectiveness of the HAL-based estimator, utilizing an undersmoothed and smoothness-adaptive fit for the conditional outcome model. Additionally, the simulations reveal that the HAL-based estimator consistently outperforms existing methods for estimating the causal dose-response curve.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being applied in the medical field, particularly in medical imaging. However, developing MLLMs for ECG signals, which are crucial in clinical settings, has been a significant challenge beyond medical imaging. Previous studies have attempted to address this by converting ECGs into several text tags using an external classifier in a training-free manner. However, this approach significantly compresses the information in ECGs and underutilizes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we directly feed the embeddings of ECGs into the LLM through a projection layer, retaining more information about ECGs and better leveraging the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our method can also effectively handle a common situation in clinical practice where it is necessary to compare two ECGs taken at different times. Recent studies found that MLLMs may rely solely on text input to provide answers, ignoring inputs from other modalities. We analyzed this phenomenon from a causal perspective in the context of ECG MLLMs and discovered that the confounder, severity of illness, introduces a spurious correlation between the question and answer, leading the model to rely on this spurious correlation and ignore the ECG input. Such models do not comprehend the ECG input and perform poorly in adversarial tests where different expressions of the same question are used in the training and testing sets. We designed a de-biased pre-training method to eliminate the confounder's effect according to the theory of backdoor adjustment. Our model performed well on the ECG-QA task under adversarial testing and demonstrated zero-shot capabilities. An interesting random ECG test further validated that our model effectively understands and utilizes the input ECG signal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAda, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAda).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Although image-based virtual try-on has made considerable progress, emerging approaches still encounter challenges in producing high-fidelity and robust fitting images across diverse scenarios. These methods often struggle with issues such as texture-aware maintenance and size-aware fitting, which hinder their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel garment perception enhancement technique, termed FitDiT, designed for high-fidelity virtual try-on using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) allocating more parameters and attention to high-resolution features. First, to further improve texture-aware maintenance, we introduce a garment texture extractor that incorporates garment priors evolution to fine-tune garment feature, facilitating to better capture rich details such as stripes, patterns, and text. Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a frequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle the size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that adapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments that fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the above design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It excels in producing well-fitting garments with photorealistic and intricate details, while also achieving competitive inference times of 4.57 seconds for a single 1024x768 image after DiT structure slimming, outperforming existing methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has attracted a surge of attention for its superior zero-shot performance and excellent transferability to downstream tasks. However, training such large-scale models usually requires substantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users with consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we investigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090 GPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the transformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage Knowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving the inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand, confronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate synthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel Pair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and negative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which could further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effectively modeling the interaction between human hands and objects is challenging due to the complex physical constraints and the requirement for high generation efficiency in applications. Prior approaches often employ computationally intensive two-stage approaches, which first generate an intermediate representation, such as contact maps, followed by an iterative optimization procedure that updates hand meshes to capture the hand-object relation. However, due to the high computation complexity during the optimization stage, such strategies often suffer from low efficiency in inference. To address this limitation, this work introduces a novel diffusion-model-based approach that generates the grasping pose in a one-stage manner. This allows us to significantly improve generation speed and the diversity of generated hand poses. In particular, we develop a Latent Diffusion Model with an Adaptation Module for object-conditioned hand pose generation and a contact-aware loss to enforce the physical constraints between hands and objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster inference, higher diversity, and superior pose quality than state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent executes the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the SOTA in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over few-shot GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a generic class of dynamic nonlinear heterogeneous parameter models that incorporate individual and time effects in both the intercept and slope. To address the incidental parameter problem inherent in this class of models, we develop an analytical bias correction procedure to construct a bias-corrected likelihood. The resulting maximum likelihood estimators are automatically bias-corrected. Moreover, likelihood-based tests statistics -- including likelihood-ratio, Lagrange-multiplier, and Wald tests -- follow the limiting chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed correction method, and an empirical application on the labor force participation of single mothers underscores its practical importance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are closing the gap to human visual perception capability rapidly, while, still lag behind on attending to subtle images details or locating small objects precisely, etc. Common schemes to tackle these issues include deploying multiple vision encoders or operating on original high-resolution images. Few studies have concentrated on taking the textual instruction into improving visual representation, resulting in losing focus in some vision-centric tasks, a phenomenon we herein termed as Amblyopia. In this work, we introduce Panther, a MLLM that closely adheres to user instruction and locates targets of interests precisely, with the finesse of a black panther. Specifically, Panther comprises three integral components: Panther-VE, Panther-Bridge, and Panther-Decoder. Panther-VE integrates user instruction information at the early stages of the vision encoder, thereby extracting the most relevant and useful visual representations. The Panther-Bridge module, equipped with powerful filtering capabilities, significantly reduces redundant visual information, leading to a substantial savings in training costs. The Panther-Decoder is versatile and can be employed with any decoder-only architecture of LLMs without discrimination. Experimental results, particularly on vision-centric benchmarks, have demonstrated the effectiveness of Panther.

The results confirm established wisdom and uncover new insights. Among well established methods HC2 standard errors with the degree of freedom specification proposed by Bell and McCaffrey (2002) perform best. To further improve the accuracy of t-tests, we propose a novel degree-of-freedom specification based on partial leverages. We also show how HC2 to HC4 standard errors can be refined by more effectively addressing the 15.6% of cases where at least one observation exhibits a leverage of one.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While small language models (SLMs) show promises for mobile deployment, their real-world performance and applications on smartphones remains underexplored. We present SlimLM, a series of SLMs optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. Through extensive experiments on a Samsung Galaxy S24, we identify the optimal trade-offs between model size (ranging from 125M to 7B parameters), context length, and inference time for efficient on-device processing. SlimLM is pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B and fine-tuned on DocAssist, our constructed dataset for summarization, question answering and suggestion tasks. Our smallest model demonstrates efficient performance on S24, while larger variants offer enhanced capabilities within mobile constraints. We evaluate SlimLM against existing SLMs, showing comparable or superior performance and offering a benchmark for future research in on-device language models. We also provide an Android application, offering practical insights into SLM deployment. Our findings provide valuable insights and illuminate the capabilities of running advanced language models on high-end smartphones, potentially reducing server costs and enhancing privacy through on-device processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Prompt tuning based on Context Optimization (CoOp) effectively adapts visual-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by inferring additional learnable prompt tokens. However, these tokens are less discriminative as they are independent of the pre-trained tokens and fail to capture input-specific knowledge, such as class-aware textual or instance-aware visual knowledge. Leveraging the discriminative and generalization capabilities inherent in pre-trained tokens, we introduce a novel approach named Self-Enhanced Prompt Tuning (SEP). The core principle of SEP involves adapting the learnable prompt tokens at each encoder layer from the corresponding self-pretrained tokens, thereby explicitly incorporating discriminative prior knowledge to enhance both textual-level and visual-level embeddings. Furthermore, SEP's self-enhanced tokens not only boost discrimination but also mitigate domain shifts in unseen domains, enhancing generalization. In practice, SEP selects several representative tokens from all pre-trained tokens for each input data at every layer of the text/visual encoders. Subsequently, a Token Fusion Module (TFM) is introduced to generate a self-enhanced token by merging these representative tokens with the learnable tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. This self-enhanced token is then concatenated with all pre-trained tokens, serving as input for subsequent encoder layers to produce the relevant embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks and tasks confirm SEP's efficacy in prompt tuning. Code: \href{Code}{https://github.com/htyao89/SEP}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work we consider estimating the probability of many (possibly dependent) binary outcomes which is at the core of many applications, e.g., multi-level treatments in causal inference, demands for bundle of products, etc. Without further conditions, the probability distribution of an M dimensional binary vector is characterized by exponentially in M coefficients which can lead to a high-dimensional problem even without the presence of covariates. Understanding the (in)dependence structure allows us to substantially improve the estimation as it allows for an effective factorization of the probability distribution. In order to estimate the probability distribution of a M dimensional binary vector, we leverage a Bahadur representation that connects the sparsity of its coefficients with independence across the components. We propose to use regularized and adversarial regularized estimators to obtain an adaptive estimator with respect to the dependence structure which allows for rates of convergence to depend on this intrinsic (lower) dimension. These estimators are needed to handle several challenges within this setting, including estimating nuisance parameters, estimating covariates, and nonseparable moment conditions. Our main results consider the presence of (low dimensional) covariates for which we propose a locally penalized estimator. We provide pointwise rates of convergence addressing several issues in the theoretical analyses as we strive for making a computationally tractable formulation. We apply our results in the estimation of causal effects with multiple binary treatments and show how our estimators can improve the finite sample performance when compared with non-adaptive estimators that try to estimate all the probabilities directly. We also provide simulations that are consistent with our theoretical findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Causal inference is the goal of randomized controlled trials and many observational studies. The first step in a formal approach to causal inference is to define the estimand of interest, and in both types of study this can be intuitively defined as the effect in an ideal trial: a hypothetical perfect randomized experiment (with representative sample, perfect adherence, etc.). The target trial framework is an increasingly popular approach to causal inference in observational studies, but clarity is lacking in how a target trial should be specified and, crucially, how it relates to the ideal trial. In this paper, we consider these questions and use an example from respiratory epidemiology to highlight challenges with an approach that is commonly seen in applications: to specify a target trial in a way that is closely aligned to the observational study (e.g. uses the same eligibility criteria, outcome measure, etc.). The main issue is that such a target trial generally deviates from the ideal trial. Thus, even if the target trial can be emulated perfectly apart from randomization, biases beyond baseline confounding are likely to remain, relative to the estimand of interest. Without consideration of the ideal trial, these biases may go unnoticed, mirroring the often-overlooked biases of actual trials. Therefore, we suggest that, in both actual trials and observational studies, specifying the ideal trial and how the target or actual trial differs from it is necessary to systematically assess all potential sources of biases, and therefore appropriately design analyses and interpret findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A major challenge in extracting information from current and upcoming surveys of cosmological Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is the limited availability of computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations. We introduce Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that leverages a large number of approximate simulations for training and a small number of high-fidelity simulations for calibration. This approach guarantees an unbiased posterior and achieves near-optimal constraining power when the approximate simulations are reasonably accurate. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that cosmological parameters can be inferred at field level from projected 2-dim dark matter density maps up to $k_{\rm max}\sim1.5\,h$/Mpc at $z=0$ by training on $\sim10^4$ Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations with transfer function correction and calibrating with $\sim10^2$ Particle-Particle (PP) simulations. The calibrated posteriors closely match those obtained by directly training on $\sim10^4$ expensive PP simulations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Our method offers a practical and scalable framework for SBI of cosmological LSS, enabling precise inference across vast volumes and down to small scales.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion models have attained prominence for their ability to synthesize a probability distribution for a given dataset via a diffusion process, enabling the generation of new data points with high fidelity. However, diffusion processes are prone to generating samples that reflect biases in a training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the continuous advancement of network technology, various emerging complex networking optimization problems have created a wide range of applications utilizing game theory. However, since game theory is a mathematical framework, game theory-based solutions often rely heavily on the experience and knowledge of human experts. Recently, the remarkable advantages exhibited by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have gained widespread attention. In this work, we propose a novel GAI-enabled game theory solution that combines the powerful reasoning and generation capabilities of GAI to the design and optimization of mobile networking. Specifically, we first outline the game theory and key technologies of GAI, and explore the advantages of combining GAI with game theory. Then, we review the contributions and limitations of existing research and demonstrate the potential application values of GAI applied to game theory in mobile networking. Subsequently, we develop a large language model (LLM)-enabled game theory framework to realize this combination, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study in secured UAV networks. Finally, we provide several directions for future extensions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Silicon Photonics-based AI Accelerators (SPAAs) have been considered as promising AI accelerators achieving high energy efficiency and low latency. While many researchers focus on improving SPAAs' energy efficiency and latency, their physical security has not been sufficiently studied. This paper first proposes a threat of thermal fault injection attacks on SPAAs based on Vector-Matrix Multipliers (VMMs) utilizing Mach-Zhender Interferometers. This paper then proposes SecONN, an optical neural network framework that is capable of not only inferences but also concurrent detection of the attacks. In addition, this paper introduces a concept of Wavelength Division Perturbation (WDP) where wavelength dependent VMM results are utilized to increase detection accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves 88.7% attack-caused average misprediction recall.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Interactive Knowledge Assistant Track (iKAT) 2024 focuses on advancing conversational assistants, able to adapt their interaction and responses from personalized user knowledge. The track incorporates a Personal Textual Knowledge Base (PTKB) alongside Conversational AI tasks, such as passage ranking and response generation. Query Rewrite being an effective approach for resolving conversational context, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs), as query rewriters. Specifically, our submitted runs explore multi-aspect query generation using the MQ4CS framework, which we further enhance with Learned Sparse Retrieval via the SPLADE architecture, coupled with robust cross-encoder models. We also propose an alternative to the previous interleaving strategy, aggregating multiple aspects during the reranking phase. Our findings indicate that multi-aspect query generation is effective in enhancing performance when integrated with advanced retrieval and reranking models. Our results also lead the way for better personalization in Conversational Search, relying on LLMs to integrate personalization within query rewrite, and outperforming human rewrite performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in applications such as automated content generation and even critical decision-making systems. However, the risk of prompt injection allows for potential manipulation of LLM outputs. While numerous attack methods have been documented, achieving full control over these outputs remains challenging, often requiring experienced attackers to make multiple attempts and depending heavily on the prompt context. Recent advancements in gradient-based white-box attack techniques have shown promise in tasks like jailbreaks and system prompt leaks. Our research generalizes gradient-based attacks to find a trigger that is (1) Universal: effective irrespective of the target output; (2) Context-Independent: robust across diverse prompt contexts; and (3) Precise Output: capable of manipulating LLM inputs to yield any specified output with high accuracy. We propose a novel method to efficiently discover such triggers and assess the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Furthermore, we discuss the substantial threats posed by such attacks to LLM-based applications, highlighting the potential for adversaries to taking over the decisions and actions made by AI agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Relational object invariants (or representation invariants) are relational properties held by the fields of a (memory) object throughout its lifetime. For example, the length of a buffer never exceeds its capacity. Automatic inference of these invariants is particularly challenging because they are often broken temporarily during field updates. In this paper, we present an Abstract Interpretation-based solution to infer object invariants. Our key insight is a new object abstraction for memory objects, where memory is divided into multiple memory banks, each containing several objects. Within each bank, the objects are further abstracted by separating the most recently used (MRU) object, represented precisely with strong updates, while the rest are summarized. For an effective implementation of this approach, we introduce a new composite abstract domain, which forms a reduced product of numerical and equality sub-domains. This design efficiently expresses relationships between a small number of variables (e.g., fields of the same abstract object). We implement the new domain in the CRAB abstract interpreter and evaluate it on several benchmarks for memory safety. We show that our approach is significantly more scalable for relational properties than the existing implementation of CRAB. For evaluating precision, we have integrated our analysis as a pre-processing step to SEABMC bounded model checker, and show that it is effective at both discharging assertions during pre-processing, and significantly improving the run-time of SEABMC.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate estimation of indoor space geometries is vital for constructing precise digital twins, whose broad industrial applications include navigation in unfamiliar environments and efficient evacuation planning, particularly in low-light conditions. This study introduces EchoScan, a deep neural network model that utilizes acoustic echoes to perform room geometry inference. Conventional sound-based techniques rely on estimating geometry-related room parameters such as wall position and room size, thereby limiting the diversity of inferable room geometries. Contrarily, EchoScan overcomes this limitation by directly inferring room floorplan maps and height maps, thereby enabling it to handle rooms with complex shapes, including curved walls. The segmentation task for predicting floorplan and height maps enables the model to leverage both low- and high-order reflections. The use of high-order reflections further allows EchoScan to infer complex room shapes when some walls of the room are unobservable from the position of an audio device. Herein, EchoScan was trained and evaluated using RIRs synthesized from complex environments, including the Manhattan and Atlanta layouts, employing a practical audio device configuration compatible with commercial, off-the-shelf devices.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Approximate all-terrain spacetimes for astrophysical applications are presented. The metrics possess five relativistic multipole moments, namely mass, rotation, mass quadrupole, charge, and magnetic dipole moment. All these spacetimes approximately satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. The first metric is generated by means of the Hoenselaers-Perj\'es method from given relativistic multipoles. The second metric is a perturbation of the Kerr-Newman metric, which makes it a relevant approximation for astrophysical calculations. The last metric is an extension of the Hartle-Thorne metric that is important for obtaining internal models of compact objects perturbatively. The electromagnetic field is calculated using Cartan forms for locally nonrotating observers. These spacetimes are relevant to infer properties of compact objects from astrophysical observations. Furthermore, the numerical implementations of these metrics are straightforward, making them versatile for simulating the potential astrophysical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign pixel-level labels to images across an unlimited range of classes. Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper leverages large-language models (LLMs) to experimentally determine optimal strategies for scaling up social media content annotation for stance detection on HPV vaccine-related tweets. We examine both conventional fine-tuning and emergent in-context learning methods, systematically varying strategies of prompt engineering across widely used LLMs and their variants (e.g., GPT4, Mistral, and Llama3, etc.). Specifically, we varied prompt template design, shot sampling methods, and shot quantity to detect stance on HPV vaccination. Our findings reveal that 1) in general, in-context learning outperforms fine-tuning in stance detection for HPV vaccine social media content; 2) increasing shot quantity does not necessarily enhance performance across models; and 3) different LLMs and their variants present differing sensitivity to in-context learning conditions. We uncovered that the optimal in-context learning configuration for stance detection on HPV vaccine tweets involves six stratified shots paired with detailed contextual prompts. This study highlights the potential and provides an applicable approach for applying LLMs to research on social media stance and skepticism detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) represents an innovative approach in graph representation learning, enabling task-specific adaptations by fine-tuning prompts without altering the underlying pre-trained model. Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CTR prediction plays a vital role in recommender systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied in recommender systems due to their emergence abilities. While leveraging semantic information from LLMs has shown some improvements in the performance of recommender systems, two notable limitations persist in these studies. First, LLM-enhanced recommender systems encounter challenges in extracting valuable information from lifelong user behavior sequences within textual contexts for recommendation tasks. Second, the inherent variability in human behaviors leads to a constant stream of new behaviors and irregularly fluctuating user interests. This characteristic imposes two significant challenges on existing models. On the one hand, it presents difficulties for LLMs in effectively capturing the dynamic shifts in user interests within these sequences, and on the other hand, there exists the issue of substantial computational overhead if the LLMs necessitate recurrent calls upon each update to the user sequences. In this work, we propose Lifelong User Behavior Modeling (LIBER) based on large language models, which includes three modules: (1) User Behavior Streaming Partition (UBSP), (2) User Interest Learning (UIL), and (3) User Interest Fusion (UIF). Initially, UBSP is employed to condense lengthy user behavior sequences into shorter partitions in an incremental paradigm, facilitating more efficient processing. Subsequently, UIL leverages LLMs in a cascading way to infer insights from these partitions. Finally, UIF integrates the textual outputs generated by the aforementioned processes to construct a comprehensive representation, which can be incorporated by any recommendation model to enhance performance. LIBER has been deployed on Huawei's music recommendation service and achieved substantial improvements in users' play count and play time by 3.01% and 7.69%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the rise of large language models (LLMs) for flexibly processing information as strings, a natural application is regression, specifically by preprocessing string representations into LLM embeddings as downstream features for metric prediction. In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> `In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Generative large language models (LLMs), which create text without direct correspondence to truth value, are widely understood to resemble the uses of language described in Frankfurt's popular monograph On Bullshit. In this paper, we offer a rigorous investigation of this topic, identifying how the phenomenon has arisen, and how it might be analysed. In this paper, we elaborate on this argument to propose that LLM-based chatbots play the 'language game of bullshit'. We use statistical text analysis to investigate the features of this Wittgensteinian language game, based on a dataset constructed to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical pseudo-scientific text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of politics and language, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of the language of bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The applications of LLM Agents are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, leading to a high demand for structured outputs that can be parsed into code, structured function calls, and embodied agent commands. These developments bring significant demands for structured generation in LLM inference. Context-free grammar is a flexible approach to enable structured generation via constrained decoding. However, executing context-free grammar requires going through several stack states over all tokens in vocabulary during runtime, bringing non-negligible overhead for structured generation. In this paper, we propose XGrammar, a flexible and efficient structure generation engine for large language models. XGrammar accelerates context-free grammar execution by dividing the vocabulary into context-independent tokens that can be prechecked and context-dependent tokens that need to be interpreted during runtime. We further build transformations to expand the grammar context and reduce the number of context-independent tokens. Additionally, we build an efficient persistent stack to accelerate the context-dependent token checks. Finally, we co-design the grammar engine with LLM inference engine to overlap grammar computation with GPU executions. Evaluation results show that XGrammar can achieve up to 100x speedup over existing solutions. Combined with an LLM inference engine, it can generate near-zero overhead structure generation in end-to-end low-LLM serving.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site, crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.   In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of 182 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but significantly constrained by significant hurdles in technical awareness, agency in deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further test and evaluate network level crawler blockers by reverse-proxies, and find that despite very limited deployment today, their reliable and comprehensive blocking of AI-crawlers make them the strongest protection for artists moving forward.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models LLMs like ChatGPT have reached the 100 Mio user barrier in record time and might increasingly enter all areas of our life leading to a diverse set of interactions between those Artificial Intelligence models and humans. While many studies have discussed governance and regulations deductively from first-order principles, few studies provide an inductive, data-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs especially when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have the potential to pose a serious threat to people. In this work, we conduct a user study engaging over 40 individuals across all age groups in price negotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM, investigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities and, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the LLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any rationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve span a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting with LLMs.

  Application to Texts as Treatments</h2>

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike the existing methods, our proposed approach eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed methodology to the settings, in which the treatment feature is based on human perception rather than is assumed to be fixed given the treatment object. The proposed methodology is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate the existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama 3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over the state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit demographic biases, yet few studies systematically evaluate these biases across multiple datasets or account for confounding factors. In this work, we examine LLM alignment with human annotations in five offensive language datasets, comprising approximately 220K annotations. Our findings reveal that while demographic traits, particularly race, influence alignment, these effects are inconsistent across datasets and often entangled with other factors. Confounders -- such as document difficulty, annotator sensitivity, and within-group agreement -- account for more variation in alignment patterns than demographic traits alone. Specifically, alignment increases with higher annotator sensitivity and group agreement, while greater document difficulty corresponds to reduced alignment. Our results underscore the importance of multi-dataset analyses and confounder-aware methodologies in developing robust measures of demographic bias in LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable success in cooperative tasks, demonstrating impressive performance and scalability. However, deploying MARL agents in real-world applications presents critical safety challenges. Current safe MARL algorithms are largely based on the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) framework, which enforces constraints only on discounted cumulative costs and lacks an all-time safety assurance. Moreover, these methods often overlook the feasibility issue (the system will inevitably violate state constraints within certain regions of the constraint set), resulting in either suboptimal performance or increased constraint violations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel theoretical framework for safe MARL with $\textit{state-wise}$ constraints, where safety requirements are enforced at every state the agents visit. To resolve the feasibility issue, we leverage a control-theoretic notion of the feasible region, the controlled invariant set (CIS), characterized by the safety value function. We develop a multi-agent method for identifying CISs, ensuring convergence to a Nash equilibrium on the safety value function. By incorporating CIS identification into the learning process, we introduce a multi-agent dual policy iteration algorithm that guarantees convergence to a generalized Nash equilibrium in state-wise constrained cooperative Markov games, achieving an optimal balance between feasibility and performance. Furthermore, for practical deployment in complex high-dimensional systems, we propose $\textit{Multi-Agent Dual Actor-Critic}$ (MADAC), a safe MARL algorithm that approximates the proposed iteration scheme within the deep RL paradigm. Empirical evaluations on safe MARL benchmarks demonstrate that MADAC consistently outperforms existing methods, delivering much higher rewards while reducing constraint violations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks. Using a dataset of previous experience is possible to provide detailed feedback about the failure. Updating the LLMs context of the next iteration with suggestion on how to overcame the issue.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Robots are increasingly being used in dynamic environments like workplaces, hospitals, and homes. As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero Trust (ZT) is a security paradigm aiming to curtail an attacker's lateral movements within a network by implementing least-privilege and per-request access control policies. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the difficulty of generating proper rules due to the lack of detailed knowledge of communication requirements and the characteristic behaviors of communicating entities under benign conditions. Consequently, manual rule generation becomes cumbersome and error-prone. To address these problems, we propose ZT-SDN, an automated framework for learning and enforcing network access control in Software-Defined Networks. ZT-SDN collects data from the underlying network and models the network "transactions" performed by communicating entities as graphs. The nodes represent entities, while the directed edges represent transactions identified by different protocol stacks observed. It uses novel unsupervised learning approaches to extract transaction patterns directly from the network data, such as the allowed protocol stacks and port numbers and data transmission behavior. Finally, ZT-SDN uses an innovative approach to generate correct access control rules and infer strong associations between them, allowing proactive rule deployment in forwarding devices. We show the framework's efficacy in detecting abnormal network accesses and abuses of permitted flows in changing network conditions with real network datasets. Additionally, we showcase ZT-SDN's scalability and the network's performance when applied in an SDN environment.

We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly improving to handle increasingly complex web-based tasks. Most of these agents rely on general-purpose, proprietary models like GPT-4 and focus on designing better prompts to improve their planning abilities. However, general-purpose LLMs are not specifically trained to understand specialized web contexts such as HTML, and they often struggle with long-horizon planning. We explore an alternative approach that fine-tunes open-source LLMs using production-scale workflow data collected from over 250 domains corresponding to 6 billion tokens. This simple yet effective approach shows substantial gains over prompting-based agents on existing benchmarks -- ScribeAgent achieves state-of-the-art direct generation performance on Mind2Web and improves the task success rate by 14.1% over the previous best text-only web agents on WebArena. We further perform detailed ablation studies on various fine-tuning design choices and provide insights into LLM selection, training recipes, context window optimization, and effect of dataset sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This research explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets for Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT) testing, a key component in evaluating user sentiment and product experience. Utilizing gpt-4o-mini, a cost-effective alternative to larger commercial LLMs, three methods, Word+Review, Review+Word, and Supply-Word, were each used to synthesize 1000 product reviews. The generated datasets were assessed for sentiment alignment, textual diversity, and data generation cost. Results demonstrated high sentiment alignment across all methods, with Pearson correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.97. Supply-Word exhibited the highest diversity and coverage of PDT terms, although with increased generation costs. Despite minor biases toward positive sentiments, in situations with limited test data, LLM-generated synthetic data offers significant advantages, including scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in dataset production.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> TIPO (Text to Image with text pre-sampling for Prompt Optimization) is an innovative framework designed to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by language model (LM) for automatic prompt engineering. By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online hate speech poses a serious threat to individual well-being and societal cohesion. A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech. However, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and may even backfire.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of the large language model~(LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing Wafer-Scale Chips~(WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads.   Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8\%/73.7\% in performance and 38.6\%/42.4\% in power consumption for LLM training, while improving up to 23.2$\times$ and 15.7$\times$ for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Legacy software systems, written in outdated languages like MUMPS and mainframe assembly, pose challenges in efficiency, maintenance, staffing, and security. While LLMs offer promise for modernizing these systems, their ability to understand legacy languages is largely unknown. This paper investigates the utilization of LLMs to generate documentation for legacy code using two datasets: an electronic health records (EHR) system in MUMPS and open-source applications in IBM mainframe Assembly Language Code (ALC). We propose a prompting strategy for generating line-wise code comments and a rubric to evaluate their completeness, readability, usefulness, and hallucination. Our study assesses the correlation between human evaluations and automated metrics, such as code complexity and reference-based metrics. We find that LLM-generated comments for MUMPS and ALC are generally hallucination-free, complete, readable, and useful compared to ground-truth comments, though ALC poses challenges. However, no automated metrics strongly correlate with comment quality to predict or measure LLM performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of current automated measures and the need for better evaluation metrics for LLM-generated documentation in legacy systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Audio description (AD) is a crucial accessibility service provided to blind persons and persons with visual impairment, designed to convey visual information in acoustic form. Despite recent advancements in multilingual machine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD data impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems that address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland. Furthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty exists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding video clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present SwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and English. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in German, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse language populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to the desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of both automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising capability of SwissADT for the ADT task. We believe that combining human expertise with the generation power of LLMs can further enhance the performance of ADT systems, ultimately benefiting a larger multilingual target population.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate barcode detection and decoding in Identity documents is crucial for applications like security, healthcare, and education, where reliable data extraction and verification are essential. However, building robust detection models is challenging due to the lack of diverse, realistic datasets an issue often tied to privacy concerns and the wide variety of document formats. Traditional tools like Faker rely on predefined templates, making them less effective for capturing the complexity of real-world identity documents. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to synthetic data generation that uses LLMs to create contextually rich and realistic data without relying on predefined field. Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents and content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real identity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on templates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student IDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields. Compared to traditional methods like Faker, data generated by LLM demonstrates greater diversity and contextual relevance, leading to improved performance in barcode detection models. This scalable, privacy-first solution is a big step forward in advancing machine learning for automated document processing and identity verification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Graphic designs are an effective medium for visual communication. They range from greeting cards to corporate flyers and beyond. Off-late, machine learning techniques are able to generate such designs, which accelerates the rate of content production. An automated way of evaluating their quality becomes critical. Towards this end, we introduce Design-o-meter, a data-driven methodology to quantify the goodness of graphic designs. Further, our approach can suggest modifications to these designs to improve its visual appeal. To the best of our knowledge, Design-o-meter is the first approach that scores and refines designs in a unified framework despite the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of the setting. Our exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach against baselines adapted for the task (including recent Multimodal LLM-based approaches) brings out the efficacy of our methodology. We hope our work will usher more interest in this important and pragmatic problem setting.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks requiring processing and interpretation of input text. Abstract screening is a labour-intensive component of systematic review involving repetitive application of inclusion and exclusion criteria on a large volume of studies identified by a literature search. Here, LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 3.5) were trialled on systematic reviews in a full issue of the Cochrane Library to evaluate their accuracy in zero-shot binary classification for abstract screening. Trials over a subset of 800 records identified optimal prompting strategies and demonstrated superior performance of LLMs to human researchers in terms of sensitivity (LLM-max = 1.000, human-max = 0.775), precision (LLM-max = 0.927, human-max = 0.911), and balanced accuracy (LLM-max = 0.904, human-max = 0.865). The best performing LLM-prompt combinations were trialled across every replicated search result (n = 119,691), and exhibited consistent sensitivity (range 0.756-1.000) but diminished precision (range 0.004-0.096). 66 LLM-human and LLM-LLM ensembles exhibited perfect sensitivity with a maximal precision of 0.458, with less observed performance drop in larger trials. Significant variation in performance was observed between reviews, highlighting the importance of domain-specific validation before deployment. LLMs may reduce the human labour cost of systematic review with maintained or improved accuracy and sensitivity. Systematic review is the foundation of evidence synthesis across academic disciplines, including evidence-based medicine, and LLMs may increase the efficiency and quality of this mode of research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored various methods to optimally leverage their comprehension and generation capabilities in sequential recommendation scenarios. However, several challenges persist in this endeavor. Firstly, most existing approaches rely on the input-output prompting paradigm, which can result in irrelevant or inaccurate responses. Secondly, while there have been attempts to enhance LLMs using prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought (CoT), these efforts have not fully harnessed the reasoning abilities of LLMs or effectively captured the multifaceted information contained within user sequences. To address these limitations, we propose GOT4Rec, a sequential recommendation method that utilizes the graph of thoughts (GoT) prompting strategy. Specifically, we identify and utilize three key types of information within user history sequences: short-term interests, long-term interests and collaborative information from other users. Our approach enables LLMs to independently reason and generate recommendations based on these distinct types of information, subsequently aggregating the results within the GoT framework to derive the final recommended items. This method allows LLMs, with enhanced reasoning capabilities, to more effectively consider the diverse information within user sequences, resulting in more accurate recommendations and more comprehensive explanations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GOT4Rec, indicating that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Task-aware robotic grasping is a challenging problem that requires the integration of semantic understanding and geometric reasoning. Traditional grasp planning approaches focus on stable or feasible grasps, often disregarding the specific tasks the robot needs to accomplish. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to enable zero-shot task-conditioned grasp selection. The framework segments objects into meaningful subparts and labels each subpart semantically, creating structured representations that can be used to prompt an LLM. By coupling semantic and geometric representations of an object's structure, the LLM's knowledge about tasks and which parts to grasp can be applied in the physical world. The QD-generated grasp archive provides a diverse set of grasps, allowing us to select the most suitable grasp based on the task. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the YCB dataset, where a Franka Emika robot is assigned to perform various actions based on object-specific task requirements. We created a ground truth by conducting a survey with six participants to determine the best grasp region for each task-object combination according to human intuition. The model was evaluated on 12 different objects across 4--7 object-specific tasks, achieving a weighted intersection over union (IoU) of 76.4% when compared to the survey data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research, yet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed literature curation process. The advent of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers in several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean queries that will select the publications to consider including in a review. This paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs for systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and Alaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of results achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source alternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis of LLMs for query generation.   Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean query for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all documents for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the results. With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using ChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then generalize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and evaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.   Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the limitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation. This examination helps to understand the gaps and potential areas for improvement in the application of LLMs to information retrieval tasks. Our findings highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential of LLMs in the domain of information retrieval and literature review automation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?   To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement.   Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.   The code used for the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDCG/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more advanced and widespread and have shown their applicability to various domains, including cybersecurity. Static malware analysis is one of the most important tasks in cybersecurity; however, it is time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, we conducted a demonstration experiment focusing on whether an LLM can be used to support static analysis. First, we evaluated the ability of the LLM to explain malware functionality. The results showed that the LLM can generate descriptions that cover functions with an accuracy of up to 90.9\%. In addition, we asked six static analysts to perform a pseudo static analysis task using LLM explanations to verify that the LLM can be used in practice. Through subsequent questionnaires and interviews with the participants, we also demonstrated the practical applicability of LLMs. Lastly, we summarized the problems and required functions when using an LLM as static analysis support, as well as recommendations for future research opportunities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) excel at retrieving information from lengthy text, but their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) face difficulties with hour-long videos, especially for temporal grounding. Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, improving the understanding, generation, and manipulation of human language across domains such as translating, summarizing, and classifying text. Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction-based LLMs can be effectively utilized for data augmentation to generate diverse and realistic text samples. This study applied prompt-based data augmentation to detect mentions of green practices in Russian social media. Detecting green practices in social media aids in understanding their prevalence and helps formulate recommendations for scaling eco-friendly actions to mitigate environmental issues. We evaluated several prompts for augmenting texts in a multi-label classification task, either by rewriting existing datasets using LLMs, generating new data, or combining both approaches. Our results revealed that all strategies improved classification performance compared to the models fine-tuned only on the original dataset, outperforming baselines in most cases. The best results were obtained with the prompt that paraphrased the original text while clearly indicating the relevant categories.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Gender bias in text corpora that are used for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as for training large language models (LLMs), can lead to the perpetuation and amplification of societal inequalities. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in gendered languages like Spanish or French, where grammatical structures inherently encode gender, making the bias analysis more challenging. A first step in quantifying gender bias in text entails computing biases in gender representation, i.e., differences in the prevalence of words referring to males vs. females. Existing methods to measure gender representation bias in text corpora have mainly been proposed for English and do not generalize to gendered languages due to the intrinsic linguistic differences between English and gendered languages. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to quantitatively measure gender representation bias in Spanish corpora. By utilizing LLMs to identify and classify gendered nouns and pronouns in relation to their reference to human entities, our approach provides a robust analysis of gender representation bias in gendered languages. We empirically validate our method on four widely-used benchmark datasets, uncovering significant gender prevalence disparities with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 4:1 to 6:1. These findings demonstrate the value of our methodology for bias quantification in gendered language corpora and suggest its application in NLP, contributing to the development of more equitable language technologies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Conversational agents are increasingly used in healthcare, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their capabilities. When integrated into social robots, LLMs offer the potential for more natural interactions. However, while LLMs promise numerous benefits, they also raise critical ethical concerns, particularly around the issue of hallucinations and deceptive patterns. In this case study, we observed a critical pattern of deceptive behavior in commercially available LLM-based care software integrated into robots. The LLM-equipped robot falsely claimed to have medication reminder functionalities. Not only did these systems assure users of their ability to manage medication schedules, but they also proactively suggested this capability, despite lacking it. This deceptive behavior poses significant risks in healthcare environments, where reliability is paramount. Our findings highlights the ethical and safety concerns surrounding the deployment of LLM-integrated robots in healthcare, emphasizing the need for oversight to prevent potentially harmful consequences for vulnerable populations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/GTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. In pursuit of performance closer to full-parameter training, a series of LoRA variants have emerged, such as LoRA+, PISSA, Olora, and LoRA-GA. This paper introduces a novel PEFT technique distinct from LoRA, called Block-Affine Adaptation (Bone). By dividing the original weights into multiple subspaces that share a single matrix for weight updates, Bone simplifies the process by requiring the trainable matrix to be initialized to zero, eliminating the need for complex initialization as in some LoRA variants. Compared to LoRA, Bone significantly reduces memory usage and achieves faster computation. Evaluation of both NLU and NLG tasks demonstrates that Bone substantially outperforms LoRA and its variants. Inspired by Pissa, we further proposed the ``Weight Guide'' theory to better utilize the information from the original weights. By integrating ``Weight Guide'' with Bone, we developed a new structure called Block-Affine Transformation (Bat), and ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of ``Weight Guide''.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research has primarily focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the the vulnerabilities of LLMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others, using three distinct evaluation methods on the CAA benchmark. Our comprehensive analysis reveals the impact of four types of audio attacks on the performance of these models, demonstrating that GPT-4o exhibits the highest level of resilience.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image manipulation can lead to misinterpretation of visual content, posing significant risks to information security. Image Manipulation Localization (IML) has thus received increasing attention. However, existing IML methods rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on one target image type but are mostly random guessing on other image types, and even joint training on multiple image types causes significant performance degradation. This hinders the deployment for real applications as it notably increases maintenance costs and the misclassification of image types leads to serious error accumulation. To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model to unify diverse IML tasks. Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalism by adopting the Modal Gate Encoder and the Dynamic Weight Decoder to adaptively determine the optimal encoding modality and the optimal decoder filters for each sample. We additionally propose an Anomaly Enhancement module that enhances the features of tampered regions with box supervision and helps the generalist model to extract common features across different IML tasks. We validate our approach on IML tasks across three major scenarios: natural images, document images, and face images. Without bells and whistles, our Omni-IML achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks with a single unified model, providing valuable strategies and insights for real-world application and future research in generalist image forensics. Our code will be publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current cybersecurity landscape is increasingly complex, with traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools struggling to capture complex and emerging vulnerabilities due to their reliance on rule-based matching. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful code analysis capabilities, but their static training data and privacy risks limit their effectiveness. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose LSAST, a novel approach that integrates LLMs with SAST scanners to enhance vulnerability detection. LSAST leverages a locally hostable LLM, combined with a state-of-the-art knowledge retrieval system, to provide up-to-date vulnerability insights without compromising data privacy. We set a new benchmark for static vulnerability analysis, offering a robust, privacy-conscious solution that bridges the gap between traditional scanners and advanced AI-driven analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that incorporating SAST results into LLM analysis significantly improves detection accuracy, identifying vulnerabilities missed by conventional methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness quantum mechanical unpredictability to produce true randomness, which is crucial for cryptography and secure communications. Among various QRNGs, source-independent QRNGs (SI-QRNGs) relax the trust on the quantum source, allowing for flexible use of advanced detectors to achieve high randomness generation rates. Continuous-variable (CV) SI-QRNGs, in particular, hold promise for practical deployment due to their simplicity and randomness generation rates comparable to trusted-device QRNGs. In this work, we propose a novel CV-SI-QRNG scheme with a single phase-insensitive detector, and provide security proof based on semi-definite programming (SDP). We introduce a dimension reduction technique, which rigorously reduces an infinite-dimensional SDP problem to a finite-dimensional one, enabling efficient computation while maintaining valid randomness lower bound. We further validate our method through simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, paving the way for practical and simple SI-QRNG implementations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the concept of autonomous microring arbitration, or \textit{wavelength arbitration}, to address the challenge of multi-microring initialization in microring-based Dense-Wavelength-Division-Multiplexed (DWDM) transceivers. This arbitration is inherently policy-driven, defining critical system characteristics such as the spectral ordering of microrings. Furthermore, to facilitate large-scale deployment, the arbitration algorithms must operate independently of specific wavelength information and be resilient to system variability. Addressing these complexities requires a holistic approach that encompasses the entire system, from device-level variabilities to the transceiver interface - this system-wide perspective is the focus of this paper. To support efficient analysis, we develop a hierarchical framework incorporating an ideal, wavelength-aware arbitration model to examine arbitration failures at both the policy and algorithmic levels. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in two ways: by analyzing the robustness of each policy in relation to device variabilities, and by developing an algorithm that achieves near-perfect alignment with the ideal model, offering superior robustness compared to the traditional sequential tuning method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While large language models (LLMs) showcase unprecedented capabilities, they also exhibit certain inherent limitations when facing seemingly trivial tasks. A prime example is the recently debated "reversal curse", which surfaces when models, having been trained on the fact "A is B", struggle to generalize this knowledge to infer that "B is A". In this paper, we examine the manifestation of the reversal curse across various tasks and delve into both the generalization abilities and the problem-solving mechanisms of LLMs. This investigation leads to a series of significant insights: (1) LLMs are able to generalize to "B is A" when both A and B are presented in the context as in the case of a multiple-choice question. (2) This generalization ability is highly correlated to the structure of the fact "A is B" in the training documents. For example, this generalization only applies to biographies structured in "[Name] is [Description]" but not to "[Description] is [Name]". (3) We propose and verify the hypothesis that LLMs possess an inherent bias in fact recalling during knowledge application, which explains and underscores the importance of the document structure to successful learning. (4) The negative impact of this bias on the downstream performance of LLMs can hardly be mitigated through training alone. These findings offer a novel perspective on interpreting LLMs' generalization through their intrinsic mechanisms and provide insights for developing more effective learning methods.

Unlike most large models that use the BPE tokenizer, Xmodel-1.5 employs a custom unigram tokenizer with 65,280 tokens, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. The model delivers competitive results across multiple languages, including Thai, Arabic, French, Chinese, and English, outperforming Alibaba's PolyLM-1.7B on respective evaluation datasets. Xmodel-1.5 excels in benchmarks like mMMLU and PIQA, and achieves state-of-the-art results in Thai. To support low-resource language research, we release Xdata_Thai, a Thai-specific evaluation dataset featuring unique linguistic challenges such as gendered particles and idioms. While the model demonstrates strong performance, there is still room for improvement in handling culturally specific nuances.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.

However, this approach significantly compresses the information in ECGs and underutilizes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we directly feed the embeddings of ECGs into the LLM through a projection layer, retaining more information about ECGs and better leveraging the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our method can also effectively handle a common situation in clinical practice where it is necessary to compare two ECGs taken at different times. Recent studies found that MLLMs may rely solely on text input to provide answers, ignoring inputs from other modalities. We analyzed this phenomenon from a causal perspective in the context of ECG MLLMs and discovered that the confounder, severity of illness, introduces a spurious correlation between the question and answer, leading the model to rely on this spurious correlation and ignore the ECG input. Such models do not comprehend the ECG input and perform poorly in adversarial tests where different expressions of the same question are used in the training and testing sets. We designed a de-biased pre-training method to eliminate the confounder's effect according to the theory of backdoor adjustment. Our model performed well on the ECG-QA task under adversarial testing and demonstrated zero-shot capabilities. An interesting random ECG test further validated that our model effectively understands and utilizes the input ECG signal.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Humans can utilize techniques to quickly acquire knowledge from specific materials in advance, such as creating self-assessment questions, enabling us to achieving related tasks more efficiently. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) usually relies on retrieval-augmented generation to exploit knowledge materials in an instant manner, or requires external signals such as human preference data and stronger LLM annotations to conduct knowledge adaptation. To unleash the self-learning potential of LLMs, we propose KBAda, an approach designed for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks involving knowledge bases. Our method utilizes iterative training with self-annotated data such as Q&A pairs and revision suggestions, enabling the model to grasp the knowledge content efficiently. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly boosting model performance in downstream tasks that require specific knowledge at a low cost. Notably, our approach achieves over 90% of the performance improvement that can be obtained by using GPT-4-turbo annotation, while relying entirely on self-supervision. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (https://github.com/thunlp/KBAda).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has attracted a surge of attention for its superior zero-shot performance and excellent transferability to downstream tasks. However, training such large-scale models usually requires substantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users with consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we investigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090 GPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the transformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage Knowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving the inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand, confronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate synthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel Pair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and negative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which could further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent executes the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the SOTA in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over few-shot GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are closing the gap to human visual perception capability rapidly, while, still lag behind on attending to subtle images details or locating small objects precisely, etc. Common schemes to tackle these issues include deploying multiple vision encoders or operating on original high-resolution images. Few studies have concentrated on taking the textual instruction into improving visual representation, resulting in losing focus in some vision-centric tasks, a phenomenon we herein termed as Amblyopia. In this work, we introduce Panther, a MLLM that closely adheres to user instruction and locates targets of interests precisely, with the finesse of a black panther. Specifically, Panther comprises three integral components: Panther-VE, Panther-Bridge, and Panther-Decoder. Panther-VE integrates user instruction information at the early stages of the vision encoder, thereby extracting the most relevant and useful visual representations. The Panther-Bridge module, equipped with powerful filtering capabilities, significantly reduces redundant visual information, leading to a substantial savings in training costs. The Panther-Decoder is versatile and can be employed with any decoder-only architecture of LLMs without discrimination. Experimental results, particularly on vision-centric benchmarks, have demonstrated the effectiveness of Panther.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While small language models (SLMs) show promises for mobile deployment, their real-world performance and applications on smartphones remains underexplored. We present SlimLM, a series of SLMs optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices. Through extensive experiments on a Samsung Galaxy S24, we identify the optimal trade-offs between model size (ranging from 125M to 7B parameters), context length, and inference time for efficient on-device processing. SlimLM is pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B and fine-tuned on DocAssist, our constructed dataset for summarization, question answering and suggestion tasks. Our smallest model demonstrates efficient performance on S24, while larger variants offer enhanced capabilities within mobile constraints. We evaluate SlimLM against existing SLMs, showing comparable or superior performance and offering a benchmark for future research in on-device language models. We also provide an Android application, offering practical insights into SLM deployment. Our findings provide valuable insights and illuminate the capabilities of running advanced language models on high-end smartphones, potentially reducing server costs and enhancing privacy through on-device processing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum digital signatures (QDSs), which utilize correlated bit strings among sender and recipients, guarantee the authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation of classical messages based on quantum laws. Continuous-variable (CV) quantum protocol with heterodyne and homodyne measurement has obvious advantages of low-cost implementation and easy wavelength division multiplexing. However, security analyses in previous researches are limited to the proof against collective attacks in finite-size scenarios. Moreover, existing multibit CV QDS schemes have primarily focused on adapting single-bit protocols for simplicity of security proof, often sacrificing signature efficiency. Here, we introduce a CV QDS protocol designed to withstand general coherent attacks through the use of a cutting-edge fidelity test function, while achieving high signature efficiency by employing a refined one-time universal hashing signing technique. Our protocol is proved to be robust against finite-size effects and excess noise in quantum channels. In simulation, results demonstrate a significant reduction of eight orders of magnitude in signature length for a megabit message signing task compared with existing CV QDS protocols and this advantage expands as the message size grows. Our work offers a solution with enhanced security and efficiency, paving the way for large-scale deployment of CV QDSs in future quantum networks.

Subsequently, we develop a large language model (LLM)-enabled game theory framework to realize this combination, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study in secured UAV networks. Finally, we provide several directions for future extensions.

Query Rewrite being an effective approach for resolving conversational context, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs), as query rewriters. Specifically, our submitted runs explore multi-aspect query generation using the MQ4CS framework, which we further enhance with Learned Sparse Retrieval via the SPLADE architecture, coupled with robust cross-encoder models. We also propose an alternative to the previous interleaving strategy, aggregating multiple aspects during the reranking phase. Our findings indicate that multi-aspect query generation is effective in enhancing performance when integrated with advanced retrieval and reranking models. Our results also lead the way for better personalization in Conversational Search, relying on LLMs to integrate personalization within query rewrite, and outperforming human rewrite performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in applications such as automated content generation and even critical decision-making systems. However, the risk of prompt injection allows for potential manipulation of LLM outputs. While numerous attack methods have been documented, achieving full control over these outputs remains challenging, often requiring experienced attackers to make multiple attempts and depending heavily on the prompt context. Recent advancements in gradient-based white-box attack techniques have shown promise in tasks like jailbreaks and system prompt leaks. Our research generalizes gradient-based attacks to find a trigger that is (1) Universal: effective irrespective of the target output; (2) Context-Independent: robust across diverse prompt contexts; and (3) Precise Output: capable of manipulating LLM inputs to yield any specified output with high accuracy. We propose a novel method to efficiently discover such triggers and assess the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Furthermore, we discuss the substantial threats posed by such attacks to LLM-based applications, highlighting the potential for adversaries to taking over the decisions and actions made by AI agents.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Encoder-based transformers, powered by self-attention layers, have revolutionized machine learning with their context-aware representations. However, their quadratic growth in computational and memory demands presents significant bottlenecks. Analog-Mixed-Signal Process-in-Memory (AMS-PiM) architectures address these challenges by enabling efficient on-chip processing. Traditionally, AMS-PiM relies on Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), which is hardware-efficient but requires extensive retraining to adapt models to AMS-PiMs, making it increasingly impractical for transformer models. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) mitigates this training overhead but introduces significant hardware inefficiencies. PTQ relies on dequantization-quantization (DQ-Q) processes, floating-point units (FPUs), and high-ENOB (Effective Number of Bits) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Particularly, High-ENOB ADCs scale exponentially in area and energy ($2^{ENOB}$), reduce sensing margins, and increase susceptibility to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, further compounding PTQ's challenges in AMS-PiM systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAP, an AMS-PiM architecture that eliminates DQ-Q processes, introduces FPU- and division-free nonlinear processing, and employs a low-ENOB-ADC-based sparse Matrix Vector multiplication technique. Using the proposed techniques, RAP improves error resiliency, area/energy efficiency, and computational speed while preserving numerical stability. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art GPUs and conventional PiM architectures in energy efficiency, latency, and accuracy, making it a scalable solution for the efficient deployment of transformers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The agriculture sector is increasingly adopting innovative technologies to meet the growing food demands of the global population. To optimize resource utilization and minimize crop losses, farmers are joining cooperatives to share their data and resources among member farms. However, while farmers benefit from this data sharing and interconnection, it exposes them to cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns. A cyberattack on one farm can have widespread consequences, affecting the targeted farm as well as all member farms within a cooperative. In this research, we address existing gaps by proposing a novel and secure architecture for Cooperative Smart Farming (CSF). First, we highlight the role of edge-based DTs in enhancing the efficiency and resilience of agricultural operations. To validate this, we develop a test environment for CSF, implementing various cyberattacks on both the DTs and their physical counterparts using different attack vectors. We collect two smart farming network datasets to identify potential threats. After identifying these threats, we focus on preventing the transmission of malicious data from compromised farms to the central cloud server. To achieve this, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based network anomaly detection model, specifically designed for deployment at the edge. As a proof of concept, we implement this model and evaluate its performance by varying the number of encoder layers. Additionally, we apply Post-Quantization to compress the model and demonstrate the impact of compression on its performance in edge environments. Finally, we compare the model's performance with traditional machine learning approaches to assess its overall effectiveness.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecule discovery is a pivotal research field, impacting everything from the medicines we take to the materials we use. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet the alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a significant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a general SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained alignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual phrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this case, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to contextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our approach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed alignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or SMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or characteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective Reflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for teacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context reflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning process of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning, integrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the Chain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect enables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous baselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement not only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption translation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) is a widely embraced paradigm for distilling artificial intelligence from distributed mobile data. However, the deployment of FL in mobile networks can be compromised by exposure to interference from neighboring cells or jammers. Existing interference mitigation techniques require multi-cell cooperation or at least interference channel state information, which is expensive in practice. On the other hand, power control that treats interference as noise may not be effective due to limited power budgets, and also that this mechanism can trigger countermeasures by interference sources. As a practical approach for protecting FL against interference, we propose Spectrum Breathing, which cascades stochastic-gradient pruning and spread spectrum to suppress interference without bandwidth expansion. The cost is higher learning latency by exploiting the graceful degradation of learning speed due to pruning. We synchronize the two operations such that their levels are controlled by the same parameter, Breathing Depth. To optimally control the parameter, we develop a martingale-based approach to convergence analysis of Over-the-Air FL with spectrum breathing, termed AirBreathing FL. We show a performance tradeoff between gradient-pruning and interference-induced error as regulated by the breathing depth. Given receive SIR and model size, the optimization of the tradeoff yields two schemes for controlling the breathing depth that can be either fixed or adaptive to channels and the learning process. As shown by experiments, in scenarios where traditional Over-the-Air FL fails to converge in the presence of strong interference, AirBreahing FL with either fixed or adaptive breathing depth can ensure convergence where the adaptive scheme achieves close-to-ideal performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper leverages large-language models (LLMs) to experimentally determine optimal strategies for scaling up social media content annotation for stance detection on HPV vaccine-related tweets. We examine both conventional fine-tuning and emergent in-context learning methods, systematically varying strategies of prompt engineering across widely used LLMs and their variants (e.g., GPT4, Mistral, and Llama3, etc.). Specifically, we varied prompt template design, shot sampling methods, and shot quantity to detect stance on HPV vaccination. Our findings reveal that 1) in general, in-context learning outperforms fine-tuning in stance detection for HPV vaccine social media content; 2) increasing shot quantity does not necessarily enhance performance across models; and 3) different LLMs and their variants present differing sensitivity to in-context learning conditions. We uncovered that the optimal in-context learning configuration for stance detection on HPV vaccine tweets involves six stratified shots paired with detailed contextual prompts. This study highlights the potential and provides an applicable approach for applying LLMs to research on social media stance and skepticism detection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> CTR prediction plays a vital role in recommender systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied in recommender systems due to their emergence abilities. While leveraging semantic information from LLMs has shown some improvements in the performance of recommender systems, two notable limitations persist in these studies. First, LLM-enhanced recommender systems encounter challenges in extracting valuable information from lifelong user behavior sequences within textual contexts for recommendation tasks. Second, the inherent variability in human behaviors leads to a constant stream of new behaviors and irregularly fluctuating user interests. This characteristic imposes two significant challenges on existing models. On the one hand, it presents difficulties for LLMs in effectively capturing the dynamic shifts in user interests within these sequences, and on the other hand, there exists the issue of substantial computational overhead if the LLMs necessitate recurrent calls upon each update to the user sequences. In this work, we propose Lifelong User Behavior Modeling (LIBER) based on large language models, which includes three modules: (1) User Behavior Streaming Partition (UBSP), (2) User Interest Learning (UIL), and (3) User Interest Fusion (UIF). Initially, UBSP is employed to condense lengthy user behavior sequences into shorter partitions in an incremental paradigm, facilitating more efficient processing. Subsequently, UIL leverages LLMs in a cascading way to infer insights from these partitions. Finally, UIF integrates the textual outputs generated by the aforementioned processes to construct a comprehensive representation, which can be incorporated by any recommendation model to enhance performance. LIBER has been deployed on Huawei's music recommendation service and achieved substantial improvements in users' play count and play time by 3.01% and 7.69%.

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce an untargeted position-aware attack objective that leverages spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, this work advances both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional reasoning capabilities, often achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory demands, due to billions of parameters, hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. A promising solution is knowledge distillation, where LLMs transfer reasoning capabilities to Small Language Models (SLMs, $\le$ 1B parameters), enabling wider deployment on low-resource devices. Existing methods primarily focus on generating high-quality reasoning rationales for distillation datasets but often neglect the critical role of data quantity and quality. To address these challenges, we propose a Feedback-Driven Distillation (FDD) framework to enhance SLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities. In the initialization stage, a distillation dataset is constructed by prompting LLMs to pair mathematical problems with corresponding reasoning rationales. We classify problems into easy and hard categories based on SLM performance. For easy problems, LLMs generate more complex variations, while for hard problems, new questions of similar complexity are synthesized. In addition, we propose a multi-round distillation paradigm to iteratively enrich the distillation datasets, thereby progressively improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of SLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can make SLMs achieve SOTA mathematical reasoning performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to address some issues within the semiconductor industry. However, they are often general-purpose models that lack the specialized knowledge needed to tackle the unique challenges of this sector, such as the intricate physics and chemistry of semiconductor devices and processes. SemiKong, the first industry-specific LLM for the semiconductor domain, provides a foundation that can be used to develop tailored proprietary models. With SemiKong 1.0, we aim to develop a foundational model capable of understanding etching problems at an expert level. Our key contributions include (a) curating a comprehensive corpus of semiconductor-related texts, (b) creating a foundational model with in-depth semiconductor knowledge, and (c) introducing a framework for integrating expert knowledge, thereby advancing the evaluation process of domain-specific AI models. Through fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM using our curated dataset, we have shown that SemiKong outperforms larger, general-purpose LLMs in various semiconductor manufacturing and design tasks. Our extensive experiments underscore the importance of developing domain-specific LLMs as a foundation for company- or tool-specific proprietary models, paving the way for further research and applications in the semiconductor domain.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We have recently witnessed that ``Intelligence" and `` Compression" are the two sides of the same coin, where the language large model (LLM) with unprecedented intelligence is a general-purpose lossless compressor for various data modalities. This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents Dynamic Context Prompting/Programming (DCP/P), a novel framework for interacting with LLMs to generate graph-based content with a dynamic context window history. While there is an existing study utilizing LLMs to generate a visual novel game, the previous study involved a manual process of output extraction and did not provide flexibility in generating a longer, coherent story. We evaluate DCP/P against our baseline, which does not provide context history to an LLM and only relies on the initial story data. Through objective evaluation, we show that simply providing the LLM with a summary leads to a subpar story compared to additionally providing the LLM with the proper context of the story. We also provide an extensive qualitative analysis and discussion. We qualitatively examine the quality of the objectively best-performing generated game from each approach. In addition, we examine biases in word choices and word sentiment of the generated content. We find a consistent observation with previous studies that LLMs are biased towards certain words, even with a different LLM family. Finally, we provide a comprehensive discussion on opportunities for future studies.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated with over 100 spatial analysis tasks with three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed research and practice across a wide range of domains. Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by delivering state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> There is widespread concern about the negative impacts of social media feed ranking algorithms on political polarization. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we develop an approach to re-rank feeds in real-time to test the effects of content that is likely to polarize: expressions of antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity (AAPA). In a preregistered 10-day field experiment on X/Twitter with 1,256 consented participants, we increase or decrease participants' exposure to AAPA in their algorithmically curated feeds. We observe more positive outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is decreased and more negative outparty feelings when AAPA exposure is increased. Exposure to AAPA content also results in an immediate increase in negative emotions, such as sadness and anger. The interventions do not significantly impact traditional engagement metrics such as re-post and favorite rates. These findings highlight a potential pathway for developing feed algorithms that mitigate affective polarization by addressing content that undermines the shared values required for a healthy democracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in deep learning have brought attention to the possibility of creating advanced, general AI systems that outperform humans across many tasks. However, if these systems pursue unintended goals, there could be catastrophic consequences. A key prerequisite for AI systems pursuing unintended goals is whether they will behave in a coherent and goal-directed manner in the first place, optimizing for some unknown goal; there exists significant research trying to evaluate systems for said behaviors. However, the most rigorous definitions of goal-directedness we currently have are difficult to compute in real-world settings. Drawing upon this previous literature, we explore policy goal-directedness within reinforcement learning (RL) environments. In our findings, we propose a different family of definitions of the goal-directedness of a policy that analyze whether it is well-modeled as near-optimal for many (sparse) reward functions. We operationalize this preliminary definition of goal-directedness and test it in toy Markov decision process (MDP) environments. Furthermore, we explore how goal-directedness could be measured in frontier large-language models (LLMs). Our contribution is a definition of goal-directedness that is simpler and more easily computable in order to approach the question of whether AI systems could pursue dangerous goals. We recommend further exploration of measuring coherence and goal-directedness, based on our findings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Matching patients effectively and efficiently for clinical trials is a significant challenge due to the complexity and variability of patient profiles and trial criteria. This paper presents a novel framework, Multi-Agents for Knowledge Augmentation (MAKA), designed to enhance patient-trial matching by dynamically supplementing matching prompts with external, domain-specific knowledge. The MAKA architecture consists of five key components: a knowledge probing agent that detects gaps in domain knowledge, a navigation agent that manages interactions among multiple specialized knowledge augmentation agents, a knowledge augmentation agent that incorporates relevant information into patient-trial matching prompts, a supervision agent aligning the outputs from other agents with the instructions and a matching agent making the final selection decision. This approach enhances the accuracy and contextual richness of patient matching, addresses inherent knowledge gaps in both trail criteria and large language models (LLMs), and improves the alignment between patient characteristics and the criteria.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely used to model and simulate human behavior, understanding their biases becomes critical. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> 3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in a 3D scene with natural language descriptions. Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods mostly utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, yet suffer from slow inference speed. To address these problems, in this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts. Our system, Constraint Satisfaction Visual Grounding (CSVG), has been extensively evaluated on the public datasets ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets using only open-source LLMs. Results show the effectiveness of CSVG and superior grounding accuracy over current state-of-the-art zero-shot 3DVG methods with improvements of $+7.0\%$ (Acc@0.5 score) and $+11.2\%$ on the ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively. The code of our system is publicly available at https://github.com/sunsleaf/CSVG.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In the field of Material Science, effective information retrieval systems are essential for facilitating research. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter challenges such as outdated information, hallucinations, limited interpretability due to context constraints, and inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, Graph RAG integrates graph databases to enhance the retrieval process. Our proposed method processes Material Science documents by extracting key entities (referred to as MatIDs) from sentences, which are then utilized to query external Wikipedia knowledge bases (KBs) for additional relevant information. We implement an agent-based parsing technique to achieve a more detailed representation of the documents. Our improved version of Graph RAG called G-RAG further leverages a graph database to capture relationships between these entities, improving both retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. This enhanced approach demonstrates significant improvements in performance for domains that require precise information retrieval, such as Material Science.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Our objective is to generate Audio Descriptions (ADs) for both movies and TV series in a training-free manner. We use the power of off-the-shelf Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and develop visual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer to characters if directly prompted with character information through visual indications without requiring any fine-tuning; (ii) A two-stage process is developed to generate ADs, with the first stage asking the VLM to comprehensively describe the video, followed by a second stage utilising a LLM to summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) A new dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach, named AutoAD-Zero, demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with some models fine-tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TV series, achieving state-of-the-art CRITIC scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive emerging capabilities and gained widespread popularity, research on LLM-based search agents has proliferated. In real-world situations, users often input contextual and highly personalized queries to chatbots, challenging LLMs to capture context and generate appropriate answers. However, much of the prior research has not focused specifically on authentic human-machine dialogue scenarios. It also ignores the important balance between response quality and computational cost by forcing all queries to follow the same agent process. To address these gaps, we propose a Strategy-Router Search Agent (SRSA), routing different queries to appropriate search strategies and enabling fine-grained serial searches to obtain high-quality results at a relatively low cost. To evaluate our work, we introduce a new dataset, Contextual Query Enhancement Dataset (CQED), comprising contextual queries to simulate authentic and daily interactions between humans and chatbots. Using LLM-based automatic evaluation metrics, we assessed SRSA's performance in terms of informativeness, completeness, novelty, and actionability. To conclude, SRSA provides an approach that resolves the issue of simple serial searches leading to degenerate answers for lengthy and contextual queries, effectively and efficiently parses complex user queries, and generates more comprehensive and informative responses without fine-tuning an LLM.

Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.

However, these systems face challenges in effectively integrating external knowledge with the LLM's internal knowledge, often leading to issues with misleading or unhelpful information. This work aims to provide a systematic study on knowledge checking in RAG systems. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of LLM representation behaviors and demonstrate the significance of using representations in knowledge checking. Motivated by the findings, we further develop representation-based classifiers for knowledge filtering. We show substantial improvements in RAG performance, even when dealing with noisy knowledge databases.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Answering end user security questions is challenging. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions.   While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The global output of academic publications exceeds 5 million articles per year, making it difficult for humans to keep up with even a tiny fraction of scientific output. We need methods to navigate and interpret the artifacts -- texts, graphs, charts, code, models, and datasets -- that make up the literature. This paper evaluates various methods for extracting mathematical model variables from epidemiological studies, such as ``infection rate ($\alpha$),'' ``recovery rate ($\gamma$),'' and ``mortality rate ($\mu$).'' Variable extraction appears to be a basic task, but plays a pivotal role in recovering models from scientific literature. Once extracted, we can use these variables for automatic mathematical modeling, simulation, and replication of published results.   We introduce a benchmark dataset comprising manually-annotated variable descriptions and variable values extracted from scientific papers. Based on this dataset, we present several baseline methods for variable extraction based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and rule-based information extraction systems. Our analysis shows that LLM-based solutions perform the best. Despite the incremental benefits of combining rule-based extraction outputs with LLMs, the leap in performance attributed to the transfer-learning and instruction-tuning capabilities of LLMs themselves is far more significant. This investigation demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance automatic comprehension of scientific artifacts and for automatic model recovery and simulation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Solar trajectory monitoring is a pivotal challenge in solar energy systems, underpinning applications such as autonomous energy harvesting and environmental sensing. A prevalent failure mode in sustained solar tracking arises when the predictive algorithm erroneously diverges from the solar locus, erroneously anchoring to extraneous celestial or terrestrial features. This phenomenon is attributable to an inadequate assimilation of solar-specific objectness attributes within the tracking paradigm. To mitigate this deficiency inherent in extant methodologies, we introduce an innovative objectness regularization framework that compels tracking points to remain confined within the delineated boundaries of the solar entity. By encapsulating solar objectness indicators during the training phase, our approach obviates the necessity for explicit solar mask computation during operational deployment. Furthermore, we leverage the high-DoF robot arm to integrate our method to improve its robustness and flexibility in different outdoor environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm without physical contact. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but still struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at inference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains challenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality, without requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of 12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and enhanced through our proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement manner. The code of LaTRO is available at \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/LaTRO}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, yet it demands more and more memory as model sizes keep growing. To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on Roberta-Large and Llama-2-7B models substantiate the efficacy of our AdaZeta framework in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and convergence speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate enhanced capabilities and reliability by reasoning more, evolving from Chain-of-Thought prompting to product-level solutions like OpenAI o1. Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> An important goal of ML research is to identify and mitigate unwanted biases intrinsic to datasets and already incorporated into pre-trained models. Previous approaches have identified biases using highly curated validation subsets, that require human knowledge to create in the first place. This limits the ability to automate the discovery of unknown biases in new datasets. We solve this by using interpretable vision-language models, combined with a filtration method using LLMs and known concept hierarchies. More exactly, for a dataset, we use pre-trained CLIP models that have an associated embedding for each class and see how it drifts through learning towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. We call this approach ConceptDrift and show that it can be scaled to automatically identify biases in datasets like ImageNet without human prior knowledge. We propose two bias identification evaluation protocols to fill the gap in the previous work and show that our method significantly improves over SoTA methods, both using our protocol and classical evaluations. Alongside validating the identified biases, we also show that they can be leveraged to improve the performance of different methods. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we empirically validate it both on image (Waterbirds, CelebA, ImageNet), and text datasets (CivilComments).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs), enterprises have been able to rapidly develop proof-of-concepts and prototypes. As a result, there is a growing need to implement robust guardrails that monitor, quantize and control an LLM's behavior, ensuring that the use is reliable, safe, accurate and also aligned with the users' expectations. Previous approaches for filtering out inappropriate user prompts or system outputs, such as LlamaGuard and OpenAI's MOD API, have achieved significant success by fine-tuning existing LLMs. However, using fine-tuned LLMs as guardrails introduces increased latency and higher maintenance costs, which may not be practical or scalable for cost-efficient deployments. We take a different approach, focusing on fine-tuning a lightweight architecture: Sentence-BERT. This method reduces the model size from LlamaGuard's 7 billion parameters to approximately 67 million, while maintaining comparable performance on the AEGIS safety benchmark.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Localizing events in videos based on semantic queries is a pivotal task in video understanding, with the growing significance of user-oriented applications like video search. Yet, current research predominantly relies on natural language queries (NLQs), overlooking the potential of using multimodal queries (MQs) that integrate images to more flexibly represent semantic queries -- especially when it is difficult to express non-verbal or unfamiliar concepts in words. To bridge this gap, we introduce ICQ, a new benchmark designed for localizing events in videos with MQs, alongside an evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. To accommodate and evaluate existing video localization models for this new task, we propose 3 Multimodal Query Adaptation methods and a novel Surrogate Fine-tuning on pseudo-MQs strategy. ICQ systematically benchmarks 12 state-of-the-art backbone models, spanning from specialized video localization models to Video LLMs, across diverse application domains. Our experiments highlight the high potential of MQs in real-world applications. We believe this benchmark is a first step toward advancing MQs in video event localization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) under-perform on low-resource languages due to limited training data. We present a method to efficiently collect text data for low-resource languages from the entire Common Crawl corpus. Our approach, UnifiedCrawl, filters and extracts common crawl using minimal compute resources, yielding mono-lingual datasets much larger than previously available sources. We demonstrate that leveraging this data to fine-tuning multilingual LLMs via efficient adapter methods (QLoRA) significantly boosts performance on the low-resource language, while minimizing VRAM usage. Our experiments show large improvements in language modeling perplexity and an increase in few-shot prompting scores. Our work and released source code provide an affordable approach to improve LLMs for low-resource languages using consumer hardware. Our source code is available here at https://github.com/bethelmelesse/unifiedcrawl.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction and emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of code-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to reason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However, students frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without fully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify and hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach effectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an innovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem description and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact with BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output differs from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This not only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills, but also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We deployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging exercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same problems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter varied in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications. Importantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually created by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that BugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Auto-SPICE is the first fully automated framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate Simulation Programs with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) netlists. It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation. Our framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, tested on approximately 2,100 schematics of varying complexity. We open-source this solution for community-driven development.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance on complex tasks, they still struggle with longer contextual understanding and high computational costs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce LLMSteer, a fine-tuning-free framework that enhances LLMs through query-independent attention steering. Tested on popular LLMs and datasets, LLMSteer narrows the performance gap with baselines by 65.9% and reduces the runtime delay by up to 4.8x compared to recent attention steering methods.
