                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current large language models are mainly based on decode-only structure transformers, which have great in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. It is generally believed that the important foundation of its ICL capability is the induction heads mechanism, which requires at least two layers attention. In order to more efficiently implement the ability of the model's induction, we revisit the induction heads mechanism and proposed a KV shifting attention. We theoretically prove that the KV shifting attention reducing the model's requirements for the depth and width of the induction heads mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that KV shifting attention is beneficial to learning induction heads and language modeling, which lead to better performance or faster convergence from toy models to the pre-training models with more than 10 B parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many real-world workloads present a challenging set of requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns for both reads and writes. We find that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency, sacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance, saturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory resources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs). Unfortunately these designs are not able to handle meet the challenging demands of such larger-than-memory, skewed workloads.   To this end, we present F2, a new key-value store that bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. F2 adopts a tiered, record-oriented architecture inspired by LSM-trees to effectively separate hot from cold records, while incorporating concurrent latch-free mechanisms from CPU-optimized engines to maximize performance on modern NVMe SSDs. To realize this design, we tackle key challenges and introduce several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction and user operations (e.g., RMWs), as well as new components: a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records and a read-cache for serving read-hot data.   Detailed experimental results show that F2 matches or outperforms existing solutions, achieving on average better throughput on memory-constrained environments compared to state-of-the-art systems like RocksDB (11.75x), SplinterDB (4.52x), KVell (10.56x), LeanStore (2.04x), and FASTER (2.38x). F2 also maintains its high performance across varying workload skewness levels and memory budgets, while achieving low disk write amplification.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) experiments provide detailed insights into material microstructures, enabling high-resolution imaging as well as crystallographic analysis through advanced techniques like Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). However, the interaction of the high-energy electron beam with the material can lead to localized heating, which may significantly impact specimen integrity, especially in applications requiring prolonged beam exposure, for instance when mapping the crystal structure using EBSD. This study examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample (iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a MEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through simulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis focuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration voltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time (from 1$\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\deg} to 70{\deg}). The findings reveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\deg}C during EBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and acceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but incur high serving costs due to substantial memory demands, with the key-value (KV) cache being a primary bottleneck. Existing KV cache compression methods, including quantization and pruning, struggle with limitations such as uniform treatment of keys and values and static memory allocation across attention heads. To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache compression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising accuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores keys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on attention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory based on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV compression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to enable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To efficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations including unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on vLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\times$ to $5.0\times$ without accuracy loss and up to $11.0\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing throughput by $1.9\times$ to $2.5\times$, and up to $6.9\times$.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Nowadays, the Hierarchical Storage System (HSS) is considered as an ideal model to meet the cost-performance demand. The data migration between storing tiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth control is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous research about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of bandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking optimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the system performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control in HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to formalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a learning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \Pascal{}, which learns to control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative way. We implement \Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three strong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical system shows that \Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and greatly improve throughput stability (2X $\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and meanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As users conveniently stream their favorite online videos, video request records are automatically stored by video content providers, which have a high chance of privacy leakage. Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting user privacy in video requests, because they cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos that are irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach would significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To tackle the problem, we first develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC, and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 59.03\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of EC is only slightly affected.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services.   To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention, allowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple attention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address this issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier layers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with residual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through adding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all subsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with single layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding from first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further visualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention concentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance representation across most layers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Online e-commerce platforms have been extending in-store shopping, which allows users to keep the canonical online browsing and checkout experience while exploring in-store shopping. However, the growing transition between online and in-store becomes a challenge to sequential recommender systems for future online interaction prediction due to the lack of holistic modeling of hybrid user behaviors (online and in-store). The challenges are twofold. First, combining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and supporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training, inference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online recommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must be redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the sequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a hybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior data by caching information from diverse data sources. Later, we introduce a model-agnostic encoder module to the sequential recommender system to interpret the user in-store transaction and augment the modeling capacity for better online interaction prediction given the hybrid user behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios. Our project page is at https://rand-ar.github.io/.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone according to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone formation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as the sum of $\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and ozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\mathrm{NO_x}$ species in the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited. Knowing whether a region is $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in generating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or regional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of precursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone concentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local precursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations are analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional and local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to determine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether the region is VOC or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is performed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the oxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a 10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah were found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties being either in a transitional state or $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local contributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake Counties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington, and Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant concentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional and local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was found to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime to be more $\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.

The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.

To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, diffusion-based methods have achieved great improvements in the video inpainting task. However, these methods still face many challenges, such as maintaining temporal consistency and the time-consuming issue. This paper proposes an advanced video inpainting framework using optical Flow-guided Efficient Diffusion, called FloED. Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where a flow branch first restores corrupted flow and a multi-scale flow adapter provides motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Additionally, a training-free latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising process using flow warping. Further introducing a flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED efficiently reduces the computational cost brought by incorporating optical flow. Comprehensive experiments in both background restoration and object removal tasks demonstrate that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art methods from the perspective of both performance and efficiency.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them to RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can process batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes the high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a high degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the most probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a "cache" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

Applying such sequences efficiently is important in many numerical linear algebra algorithms for eigenvalues. Our algorithm is novel in three main ways. First, we introduce a new kernel that is optimized for register reuse in a novel way. Second, we introduce a blocking and packing scheme that improves the cache efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we thoroughly analyze the memory operations of the algorithm which leads to important theoretical insights and makes it easier to select good parameters. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a flop rate close to the theoretical peak on modern hardware.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and question-answering capabilities, having been widely deployed in privacy-sensitive domains like finance and medical consultation. During LLM inferences, cache-sharing methods are commonly employed to enhance efficiency by reusing cached states or responses for the same or similar inference requests. However, we identify that these cache mechanisms pose a risk of private input leakage, as the caching can result in observable variations in response times, making them a strong candidate for a timing-based attack hint.   In this study, we propose a novel timing-based side-channel attack to execute input theft in LLMs inference. The cache-based attack faces the challenge of constructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached user queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components. The input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based approaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized search mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer implements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache hit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's search strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success rates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities associated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of prioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.

Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We consider a dynamic content caching problem wherein the contents get updated at a central server, and local copies of a subset of contents are cached at a local cache associated with a Base station (BS). When a content request arrives, based on whether the content is in the local cache, the BS can decide whether to fetch the content from the central server or serve the cached version from the local cache. Fetching a content incurs a fixed fetching cost, and serving the cached version incurs an ageing cost proportional to the age-of-version (AoV) of the content. The BS has only partial information regarding AoVs of the contents. We formulate an optimal content fetching and caching problem to minimize the average cost subject to cache capacity constraints. The problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is provably hard to solve. We formulate this problem as a continuous time restless multi-armed bandit process (RMAB), where a single content problem of the corresponding RMAB is a partially observable Markov decision process. We reformulate the single content problem as a semi-Markov decision process, prove indexability, and provide a Whittle index based solution to this problem. Finally, we compare the performance with recent work and show that our proposed policy is optimal via simulations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising. Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Serving numerous users and requests concurrently requires good fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving system. This ensures that, at the same cost, the system can meet the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of more users , such as time to first token (TTFT) and time between tokens (TBT), rather than allowing a few users to experience performance far exceeding the SLOs. To achieve better fairness, the preemption-based scheduling policy dynamically adjusts the priority of each request to maintain balance during runtime. However, existing systems tend to overly prioritize throughput, overlooking the overhead caused by preemption-induced context switching, which is crucial for maintaining fairness through priority adjustments. In this work, we identify three main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O utilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn conversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy in existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to discontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond, we introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns with existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context switching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across different tail TTFT and TBT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT), an emerging image and video generation model architecture, has demonstrated great potential because of its high generation quality and scalability properties. Despite the impressive performance, its practical deployment is constrained by computational complexity and redundancy in the sequential denoising process. While feature caching across timesteps has proven effective in accelerating diffusion models, its application to DiT is limited by fundamental architectural differences from U-Net-based approaches. Through empirical analysis of DiT feature dynamics, we identify that significant feature variation between DiT blocks presents a key challenge for feature reusability. To address this, we convert standard DiT into Skip-DiT with skip branches to enhance feature smoothness. Further, we introduce Skip-Cache which utilizes the skip branches to cache DiT features across timesteps at the inference time. We validated effectiveness of our proposal on different DiT backbones for video and image generation, showcasing skip branches to help preserve generation quality and achieve higher speedup. Experimental results indicate that Skip-DiT achieves a 1.5x speedup almost for free and a 2.2x speedup with only a minor reduction in quantitative metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional latent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly, we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache, which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

By dynamically updating the key-value vector sequences, the BCT achieves efficient inference within limited cache capacity, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance and system throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCT significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining the model's inference quality, offering a new solution for efficient inference in large language models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> When predicting the next token in a sequence, vanilla transformers compute attention over all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic scaling of compute with sequence length. State-space models compress the entire sequence of tokens into a fixed-dimensional representation to improve efficiency, while other architectures achieve sub-quadratic complexity via low-rank projections or sparse attention patterns over the sequence. In this paper, we introduce Attamba, a novel architecture that uses state-space models to compress chunks of tokens and applies attention on these compressed key-value representations. We find that replacing key and value projections in a transformer with SSMs can improve model quality and enable flexible token chunking, resulting in 24% improved perplexity with transformer of similar KV-Cache and attention footprint, and ~4 times smaller KV-Cache and Attention FLOPs for 5% perplexity trade-off. Attamba can perform attention on chunked-sequences of variable length, enabling a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling, offering adaptable efficiency gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper studies cache-aided wireless networks in the presence of active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided wireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement, delivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable scheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side information), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the network's parameters. We derive the achievable one-shot sum-DoF for different sizes of cache memories, network configurations, and numbers of IRS elements. Our results highlight the potential of deploying an IRS in cache-aided wireless communication systems, underscoring the enhancement of achievable DoF for various parameter regimes, particularly when the sizes of the caches (especially at the transmitters) are inadequate. Notably, we show that access to an IRS with a sufficient number of elements enables the achievement of the maximum possible DoF for various parameter regimes of interest.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models.

We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 95-100% of accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to store intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental computation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for KV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring the entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from activations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe bus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality. To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer networks, driven by self-attention, are central to Large Language Models. In generative Transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks.   We present a custom self-attention in-memory computing architecture based on emerging charge-based memories called gain cells, which can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation and enable parallel analog dot-product computation required for self-attention. However, the analog gain cell circuits introduce non-idealities and constraints preventing the direct mapping of pre-trained models. To circumvent this problem, we design an initialization algorithm achieving text processing performance comparable to GPT-2 without training from scratch. Our architecture respectively reduces attention latency and energy consumption by up to two and five orders of magnitude compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power generative Transformers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has traditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We present Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a high-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost similar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution semantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically generates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a state-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them into a self-adaptive system.   We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler, and the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of the art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by Deegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag register optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT polymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction, type-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and JIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided by the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the disassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the generated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in state-of-the-art VMs.   We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using Deegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than the official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter. LJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance is on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44 benchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) has attracted increasing attention for tackling the issue of distribution shift during the test phase. While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts to perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including fraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they are prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like time-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two critical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models are supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high variance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques do not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In addition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads caused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and accurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose TASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on training dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual, structural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the bottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal neighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance of TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets, TASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training time.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced interactive segmentation but is limited by the high computational cost on high-resolution images. This requires downsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details needed for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's limitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight model named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions to generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the extrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin attention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework, using CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within FLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared to traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to enhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State Space models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop the HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data augmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight computational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs surpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation, the extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower latency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the previous SOTA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can be a precise, minimally invasive treatment method for liver cancer and liver metastases. However, the effectiveness of SBRT relies on the accurate delivery of the dose to the tumor while sparing healthy tissue. Challenges persist in ensuring breath-hold reproducibility, with current methods often requiring manual verification of liver dome positions from kV-triggered images. To address this, we propose a proof-of-principle study of a deep learning-based pipeline to automatically delineate the liver dome from kV-planar images. From 24 patients who received SBRT for liver cancer or metastasis inside liver, 711 KV-triggered images acquired for online breath-hold verification were included in the current study. We developed a pipeline comprising a trained U-Net for automatic liver dome region segmentation from the triggered images followed by extraction of the liver dome via thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations. The performance and generalizability of the pipeline was evaluated using 2-fold cross validation. The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation took under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any triggered image took less than one second. The RMSE and rate of detection for Fold1 with 366 images was (6.4 +/- 1.6) mm and 91.7%, respectively. For Fold2 with 345 images, the RMSE and rate of detection was (7.7 +/- 2.3) mm and 76.3% respectively.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reuse distance analysis is a widely recognized method for application characterization that illustrates cache locality. Although there are various techniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is both time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory traces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a promisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without running the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static analysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an input program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the execution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory accesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a recursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a separate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a temporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller profiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We use this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our model can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to the dynamic reuse profile methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has been widely used in various downstream vision tasks. The few-shot learning paradigm has been widely adopted to augment its capacity for these tasks. However, current paradigms may struggle with fine-grained classification, such as satellite image recognition, due to widening domain gaps. To address this limitation, we propose retrieval-enhanced visual prompt learning (RePrompt), which introduces retrieval mechanisms to cache and reuse the knowledge of downstream tasks. RePrompt constructs a retrieval database from either training examples or external data if available, and uses a retrieval mechanism to enhance multiple stages of a simple prompt learning baseline, thus narrowing the domain gap. During inference, our enhanced model can reference similar samples brought by retrieval to make more accurate predictions. A detailed analysis reveals that retrieval helps to improve the distribution of late features, thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks. Reprompt attains state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of vision datasets, including 11 image datasets, 3 video datasets, 1 multi-view dataset, and 4 domain generalization benchmarks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models are revolutionizing every aspect of human life. However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.

Compute-effective classification models are needed for low-resource environments, most notably on edge devices. We introduce Adaptable Embeddings Networks (AEN), a novel dual-encoder architecture using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This architecture allows for runtime adaptation of classification criteria without retraining and is non-autoregressive. Through thorough synthetic data experimentation, we demonstrate our model outputs comparable and in certain cases superior results to that of autoregressive models an order of magnitude larger than AEN's size. The architecture's ability to preprocess and cache condition embeddings makes it ideal for edge computing applications and real-time monitoring systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The advent of foundation models have revolutionized various fields, enabling unprecedented task accuracy and flexibility in computational linguistics, computer vision and other domains. Attention mechanism has become an essential component of foundation models, due to their superb capability of capturing correlations in a sequence. However, attention results in quadratic complexity in memory and compute as the context length grows. Although many fusion-based exact attention acceleration algorithms have been developed for datacenter-grade GPUs and accelerators leveraging multi-core parallelism and data locality, yet it remains a significant challenge to accelerate attention on resource-constrained edge neural accelerators with limited compute units and stringent on-chip caches. In this paper, we propose a scheme for exact attention inference acceleration on memory-constrained edge accelerators, by parallelizing the utilization of heterogeneous compute units, i.e., vector processing units and matrix processing units. Our method involves scheduling workloads onto these different compute units in a multi-tiered tiling scheme to process tiled vector workloads and matrix workloads in attention as two streams, respecting the workload dependencies. We search for tiling factors to maximize the parallelization of both compute units while considering I/O overhead, and propose a proactive cache overwrite strategy to avoid undesirable cache spills in reality. Extensive results based on open-sourced simulation frameworks show up to 2.75x speedup and 54% reduction in energy consumption as compared to the state-of-the-art attention fusion method (FLAT) in the edge computing scenario. Further experiments on a real-world edge neural processing unit demonstrate speedup of up to 1.76x for attention as compared to FLAT, without affecting model output accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Various numerical methods used for solving partial differential equations (PDE) result in tridiagonal systems. Solving tridiagonal systems on distributed-memory environments is not straightforward, and often requires significant amount of communication. In this article, we present a novel distributed-memory tridiagonal solver algorithm, DistD2-TDS, based on a specialised data structure. DistD2-TDS algorithm takes advantage of the diagonal dominance in tridiagonal systems to reduce the communications in distributed-memory environments. The underlying data structure plays a crucial role for the performance of the algorithm. First, the data structure improves data localities and makes it possible to minimise data movements via cache blocking and kernel fusion strategies. Second, data continuity enables a contiguous data access pattern and results in efficient utilisation of the available memory bandwidth. Finally, the data layout supports vectorisation on CPUs and thread level parallelisation on GPUs for improved performance. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm, we implemented and benchmarked the algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. We investigated the single rank performance and compared against existing algorithms. Furthermore, we analysed the strong scaling of the implementation up to 384 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and up to 8192 AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs. Finally, we demonstrated a practical use case of the algorithm by using compact finite difference schemes to solve a 3D non-linear PDE. The results demonstrate that DistD2 algorithm can sustain around 66% of the theoretical peak bandwidth at scale on CPU and GPU based supercomputers.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.   The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at https://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper proposes an intelligent cache management strategy based on CNN-LSTM to improve the performance and cache hit rate of storage systems. Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The typical selective state-space model (SSM) of Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and significant inference-time memory requirements due to the key-value cache. However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose training and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to considerable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient large language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba models are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than post-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing memory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model. Our study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under low-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized hardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, with the significant evolution of multi-modal large models, many recommender researchers realized the potential of multi-modal information for user interest modeling. In industry, a wide-used modeling architecture is a cascading paradigm: (1) first pre-training a multi-modal model to provide omnipotent representations for downstream services; (2) The downstream recommendation model takes the multi-modal representation as additional input to fit real user-item behaviours. Although such paradigm achieves remarkable improvements, however, there still exist two problems that limit model performance: (1) Representation Unmatching: The pre-trained multi-modal model is always supervised by the classic NLP/CV tasks, while the recommendation models are supervised by real user-item interaction. As a result, the two fundamentally different tasks' goals were relatively separate, and there was a lack of consistent objective on their representations; (2) Representation Unlearning: The generated multi-modal representations are always stored in cache store and serve as extra fixed input of recommendation model, thus could not be updated by recommendation model gradient, further unfriendly for downstream training. Inspired by the two difficulties challenges in downstream tasks usage, we introduce a quantitative multi-modal framework to customize the specialized and trainable multi-modal information for different downstream models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an accelerated spherical K-means clustering algorithm for large-scale and high-dimensional sparse document data sets. We design an algorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a procedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of instructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern computer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal characteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are skewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a feature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of the number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding terms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity between an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an inverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with high-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly introduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three parts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural parameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to that of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index structure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing the cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance in large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art techniques.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/xdit-project/DiTCacheAnalysis.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The growing volume of graph data may exhaust the main memory. It is crucial to design a disk-based graph storage system to ingest updates and analyze graphs efficiently. However, existing dynamic graph storage systems suffer from read or write amplification and face the challenge of optimizing both read and write performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose LSMGraph, a novel dynamic graph storage system that combines the write-friendly LSM-tree and the read-friendly CSR. It leverages the multi-level structure of LSM-trees to optimize write performance while utilizing the compact CSR structures embedded in the LSM-trees to boost read performance. LSMGraph uses a new memory structure, MemGraph, to efficiently cache graph updates and uses a multi-level index to speed up reads within the multi-level structure. Furthermore, LSMGraph incorporates a vertex-grained version control mechanism to mitigate the impact of LSM-tree compaction on read performance and ensure the correctness of concurrent read and write operations. Our evaluation shows that LSMGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (graph) storage systems on both graph update and graph analytical workloads.

KV-Tandem enables advanced functionalities such as range queries and snapshot reads, while maintaining the native KVS performance for random reads and writes. Its modular design offers better performance trade-offs compared to previous KV-separation solutions, which struggle to decompose the monolithic LSM structure. Central to KV-Tandem is~\emph{LSM bypass} -- a novel algorithm that offers a fast path to basic operations while ensuring the correctness of advanced APIs.   We implement KV-Tandem in \emph{XDP-Rocks}, a RocksDB-compatible storage engine that leverages the XDP KVS and incorporates practical design optimizations for real-world deployment. Through extensive microbenchmark and system-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x performance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is already deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings consistent with these performance gains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based NLP models are powerful but have high computational costs that limit deployment. Finetuned encoder-decoder models are popular in specialized domains and can outperform larger more generalized decoder-only models, such as GPT-4. We introduce a new configuration for encoder-decoder models that improves efficiency on structured output and decomposable tasks where multiple outputs are required for a single shared input. Our method, prompt-in-decoder (PiD), encodes the input once and decodes the output in parallel, boosting both training and inference efficiency by avoiding duplicate input encoding and increasing the operational intensity (ratio of numbers of arithmetic operation to memory access) of decoding process by sharing the input key-value cache. We achieve computation reduction that roughly scales with the number of subtasks, gaining up to 4.6x speed-up over state-of-the-art models for dialogue state tracking, summarization, and question-answering tasks, with comparable or better performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The vision tokens in multimodal large language models usually exhibit significant spatial and temporal redundancy and take up most of the input tokens, which harms their inference efficiency. To solve this problem, some recent works were introduced to drop the unimportant tokens during inference where the importance of each token is decided only by the information in either the vision encoding stage or the prefilling stage. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Token Dropping (MustDrop) to measure the importance of each token from the whole lifecycle, including the vision encoding stage, prefilling stage, and decoding stage. Concretely, in the visual encoding stage, MustDrop merges spatially adjacent tokens with high similarity, and establishes a key token set to retain the most vision-critical tokens, preventing them from being discarded in later stages. In the prefilling stage, MustDrop further compresses vision tokens by the guidance of text semantics, with a dual-attention filtering strategy. In the decoding stage, an output-aware cache policy is proposed to further reduce the size of the KV cache. By leveraging tailored strategies in the multi-stage process, MustDrop can more precisely recognize the important and redundant tokens, thus achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. For instance, MustDrop reduces about 88.5\% FLOPs on LLaVA with a compression ratio of 92.2\% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software caches are an intrinsic component of almost every computer system. Consequently, caching algorithms, particularly eviction policies, are the topic of many papers. Almost all these prior papers evaluate the caching algorithm based on its hit ratio, namely the fraction of requests that are found in the cache, as opposed to disk. The hit ratio is viewed as a proxy for traditional performance metrics like system throughput or response time. Intuitively it makes sense that higher hit ratio should lead to higher throughput (and lower response time), since more requests are found in the cache (low access time) as opposed to the disk (high access time).   This paper challenges this intuition. We show that increasing the hit ratio can actually hurt the throughput (and response time) for many caching algorithms. Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i) queueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii) simulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that the phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be more pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and higher numbers of cores per CPU.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as powerful generative models for various tasks, including image, video, and speech synthesis. However, their inference process remains computationally expensive due to the repeated evaluation of resource-intensive attention and feed-forward modules. To address this, we introduce SmoothCache, a model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiT architectures. SmoothCache leverages the observed high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities. We showcase its effectiveness on DiT-XL for image generation, Open-Sora for text-to-video, and Stable Audio Open for text-to-audio, highlighting its potential to enable real-time applications and broaden the accessibility of powerful DiT models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The factorization of skew-symmetric matrices is a critically understudied area of dense linear algebra (DLA), particularly in comparison to that of symmetric matrices. While some algorithms can be adapted from the symmetric case, the cost of algorithms can be reduced by exploiting skew-symmetry. A motivating example is the factorization $X=LTL^T$ of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$, which is used in practical applications as a means of determining the determinant of $X$ as the square of the (cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$, for example in fields such as quantum electronic structure and machine learning. Such applications also often require pivoting in order to improve numerical stability. In this work we explore a combination of known literature algorithms and new algorithms recently derived using formal methods. High-performance parallel CPU implementations are created, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce memory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides high-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We find that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via parallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for obtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear and close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper addresses the challenge of edge caching in dynamic environments, where rising traffic loads strain backhaul links and core networks. We propose a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based caching strategy that fully incorporates key file attributes such as size, lifetime, importance, and popularity, while also considering random file request arrivals, reflecting more realistic edge caching scenarios. In dynamic environments, changes such as shifts in content popularity and variations in request rates frequently occur, making previously learned policies less effective as they were optimized for earlier conditions. Without adaptation, caching efficiency and response times can degrade. While learning a new policy from scratch in a new environment is an option, it is highly inefficient and computationally expensive. Thus, adapting an existing policy to these changes is critical. To address this, we develop a mechanism that detects changes in content popularity and request rates, ensuring timely adjustments to the caching strategy. We also propose a transfer learning-based PPO algorithm that accelerates convergence in new environments by leveraging prior knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our approach, outperforming a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a system that allows for accurate, fast, and robust estimation of camera parameters and depth maps from casual monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Most conventional structure from motion and monocular SLAM techniques assume input videos that feature predominantly static scenes with large amounts of parallax. Such methods tend to produce erroneous estimates in the absence of these conditions. Recent neural network-based approaches attempt to overcome these challenges; however, such methods are either computationally expensive or brittle when run on dynamic videos with uncontrolled camera motion or unknown field of view. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of a deep visual SLAM framework: with careful modifications to its training and inference schemes, this system can scale to real-world videos of complex dynamic scenes with unconstrained camera paths, including videos with little camera parallax. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos demonstrate that our system is significantly more accurate and robust at camera pose and depth estimation when compared with prior and concurrent work, with faster or comparable running times.

In this grid, each row contains frames sharing the same timestep, while each column contains frames from the same viewpoint. We propose a novel two-stream architecture. One stream performs viewpoint updates on columns, and the other stream performs temporal updates on rows. After each diffusion transformer layer, a synchronization layer exchanges information between the two token streams. We propose two implementations of the synchronization layer, using either hard or soft synchronization. This feedforward architecture improves upon previous work in three ways: higher inference speed, enhanced visual quality (measured by FVD, CLIP, and VideoScore), and improved temporal and viewpoint consistency (measured by VideoScore and Dust3R-Confidence).

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Latent variable generative models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks including image and video synthesis. These models are enabled by pretrained autoencoders that map high resolution data into a compressed lower dimensional latent space, where the generative models can subsequently be developed while requiring fewer computational resources. Despite their effectiveness, the direct application of latent variable models to higher dimensional domains such as videos continues to pose challenges for efficient training and inference. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder that projects volumetric data onto a four-plane factorized latent space that grows sublinearly with the input size, making it ideal for higher dimensional data like videos. The design of our factorized model supports straightforward adoption in a number of conditional generation tasks with latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as class-conditional generation, frame prediction, and video interpolation. Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space retains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite the heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with significant improvements in speed and memory.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employ the Simulator Expansion for Likelihood-Free Inference (SELFI) algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilise to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of N-body simulations. Second, we obtain a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we rely on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full-forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in unifying image comprehension and generation within Large Language Models (LLMs). This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a generative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the effectiveness of data selection for large language models (LLMs) during pretraining and instruction fine-tuning phases, improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While autoregressive machine-learning-based emulators have been trained to produce stable and accurate rollouts in the climate of the present-day and recent past, none so far have been trained to emulate the sensitivity of climate to substantial changes in CO$_2$ or other greenhouse gases. As an initial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model (hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection of equilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels of CO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios with CO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training.   ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sample and out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergent time-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change with CO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile of atmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates with increased CO$_2$ closely agree with the reference model. Non-equilibrium-climate inference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing gradually at a rate of 2% year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the global annual mean trends of surface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but produces unphysical jumps in stratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling of CO$_2$, ML-controlled fields transition unrealistically quickly to the 4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing so they violate global energy conservation and exhibit unphysical sensitivities of and surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes to instantaneous changes in CO$_2$. Future emulator development needed to address these issues should improve its generalizability to diverse climate change scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to steer diffusion models away from producing undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts or avoid specific visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. We introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance through images by selectively pushing apart matching visual features between reference and generated images during the reverse diffusion process. By simply adjusting the used reference, NegToMe enables a diverse range of applications. Notably, when using other images in same batch as reference, we find that NegToMe significantly enhances output diversity (e.g., racial, gender, visual) by guiding features of each image away from others. Similarly, when used w.r.t. copyrighted reference images, NegToMe reduces visual similarity to copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (<4%) inference time and is compatible with different diffusion architectures, including those like Flux, which don't natively support the use of a negative prompt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed human-computer interactions by enabling seamless, natural, and context-aware communication. While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust, multi-layered security measures tailored to mitigate vulnerabilities at the LLM level and within broader agent-based architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Shared training approaches, such as multi-task learning (MTL) and gradient-based meta-learning, are widely used in various machine learning applications, but they often suffer from negative transfer, leading to performance degradation in specific tasks. While several optimisation techniques have been developed to mitigate this issue for pre-selected task cohorts, identifying optimal task combinations for joint learning - known as task grouping - remains underexplored and computationally challenging due to the exponential growth in task combinations and the need for extensive training and evaluation cycles. This paper introduces an efficient task grouping framework designed to reduce these overwhelming computational demands of the existing methods. The proposed framework infers pairwise task similarities through a sample-wise optimisation landscape analysis, eliminating the need for the shared model training required to infer task similarities in existing methods. With task similarities acquired, a graph-based clustering algorithm is employed to pinpoint near-optimal task groups, providing an approximate yet efficient and effective solution to the originally NP-hard problem. Empirical assessments conducted on 8 different datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework, revealing a five-fold speed enhancement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework consistently demonstrates comparable performance, confirming its remarkable efficiency and effectiveness in task grouping.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Quantum amplitude estimation is a fundamental routine that offers a quadratic speed-up over classical approaches. The original QAE protocol is based on phase estimation. The associated circuit depth and width, and the assumptions of fault tolerance, are unfavorable for near-term quantum technology. Subsequent approaches attempt to replace the original protocol with hybrid iterative quantum-classical strategies. In this work, we introduce BAE, a noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for QAE that combines quantum circuits with a statistical inference backbone. BAE can dynamically characterize device noise and adapt to it in real-time. Problem-specific insights and approximations are used to keep the problem tractable. We further propose an annealed variant of BAE, drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance statistical robustness. Our proposal is parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offers tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, it accommodates experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We show that BAE achieves Heisenberg-limited estimation and benchmark it against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The red supergiant (RSG) problem, which describes the apparent lack of high-luminosity progenitors detected in Type II supernova (SN) pre-images, has been a contentious topic for two decades. We re-assess this problem using a new RSG population of the Milky Way supplemented with RSGs from other galaxies in the Local Group. In particular, we quantify the uncertainties inherent to assumptions made regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction. We find that only M3 or later RSGs reproduce the steepness seen from the SN II pre-imaged sample. To assess the significance of the RSG problem, we build a metallicity-weighted cumulative luminosity distribution of M3 or later RSGs and directly compare it to the luminosity distribution of SN II pre-imaged progenitors. We find no evidence of missing high-luminosity pre-imaged progenitors since the uncertainties on the pre-imaged SN progenitors and single-band derived luminosity are too large to meaningfully infer population differences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in many long-context tasks. However, due to high annotation costs, high-quality long-context summary datasets for training or evaluation are scarce, limiting further research. In this work, we introduce CNNSum, a new multi-scale Chinese long-context novel summarization benchmark, including four subsets, length covering 16k\textasciitilde128k, 695 samples in total, the annotations are human-driven. We evaluate commercial and open-source models on CNNSum and conduct a detailed analysis. Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration with short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due to excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths are the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context summaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a large performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned Chat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning cannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit strong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when combined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contextual Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on emerging Transformer models is predicted to drive the next technology revolution in interactive wearable devices such as new-generation smart glasses. By coupling numerous sensors with small, low-power Micro-Controller Units (MCUs), these devices will enable on-device intelligence and sensor control. A major bottleneck in this class of systems is the small amount of on-chip memory available in the MCUs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to deploy real-world Transformers on low-power wearable devices with minimal off-chip traffic exploiting a distributed system of MCUs, partitioning inference across multiple devices and enabling execution with stationary on-chip weights. We validate the scheme by deploying the TinyLlama-42M decoder-only model on a system of 8 parallel ultra-low-power MCUs. The distributed system achieves an energy consumption of 0.64 mJ, a latency of 0.54 ms per inference, a super-linear speedup of 26.1 x, and an Energy Delay Product (EDP) improvement of 27.2 x, compared to a single-chip system. On MobileBERT, the distributed system's runtime is 38.8 ms, with a super-linear 4.7 x speedup when using 4 MCUs compared to a single-chip system.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare applications offers promising advancements in medical diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care. However, the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial attacks poses a significant threat, potentially leading to harmful outcomes in delicate medical contexts. This study investigates the vulnerability of LLMs to two types of adversarial attacks in three medical tasks. Utilizing real-world patient data, we demonstrate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs are susceptible to manipulation across multiple tasks. This research further reveals that domain-specific tasks demand more adversarial data in model fine-tuning than general domain tasks for effective attack execution, especially for more capable models. We discover that while integrating adversarial data does not markedly degrade overall model performance on medical benchmarks, it does lead to noticeable shifts in fine-tuned model weights, suggesting a potential pathway for detecting and countering model attacks. This research highlights the urgent need for robust security measures and the development of defensive mechanisms to safeguard LLMs in medical applications, to ensure their safe and effective deployment in healthcare settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Due to the significant time and effort required for handcrafting translations, most manga never leave the domestic Japanese market. Automatic manga translation is a promising potential solution. However, it is a budding and underdeveloped field and presents complexities even greater than those found in standard translation due to the need to effectively incorporate visual elements into the translation process to resolve ambiguities. In this work, we investigate to what extent multimodal large language models (LLMs) can provide effective manga translation, thereby assisting manga authors and publishers in reaching wider audiences. Specifically, we propose a methodology that leverages the vision component of multimodal LLMs to improve translation quality and evaluate the impact of translation unit size, context length, and propose a token efficient approach for manga translation. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation dataset -- the first parallel Japanese-Polish manga translation dataset -- as part of a benchmark to be used in future research. Finally, we contribute an open-source software suite, enabling others to benchmark LLMs for manga translation. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results for Japanese-English translation and set a new standard for Japanese-Polish.

In this paper, we demonstrate that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings. In particular, we show that only 10\% of poor quality votes by apathetic (site visitors not appropriately incentivized to give correct votes) or adversarial (bad actors seeking to inflate the ranking of a target model) annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard. Finally, we discuss open challenges in ensuring high-quality human annotations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While motion generation has made substantial progress, its practical application remains constrained by dataset diversity and scale, limiting its ability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this, we propose a simple and effective baseline, RMD, which enhances the generalization of motion generation through retrieval-augmented techniques. Unlike previous retrieval-based methods, RMD requires no additional training and offers three key advantages: (1) the external retrieval database can be flexibly replaced; (2) body parts from the motion database can be reused, with an LLM facilitating splitting and recombination; and (3) a pre-trained motion diffusion model serves as a prior to improve the quality of motions obtained through retrieval and direct combination. Without any training, RMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable advantages on out-of-distribution data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance models' MT ability. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 79K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from different languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.58-3.09 BLEU and 1.00-2.03 COMET scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present a novel framework for estimation and inference with the broad class of universal approximators. Estimation is based on the decomposition of model predictions into Shapley values. Inference relies on analyzing the bias and variance properties of individual Shapley components. We show that Shapley value estimation is asymptotically unbiased, and we introduce Shapley regressions as a tool to uncover the true data generating process from noisy data alone. The well-known case of the linear regression is the special case in our framework if the model is linear in parameters. We present theoretical, numerical, and empirical results for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as our guiding example.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment. All source code and the dataset will be made available on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent approaches to large language model (LLM) alignment typically require millions of human annotations or rely on external aligned models for synthetic data generation. This paper introduces ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation, demonstrating that effective alignment can be achieved using only 9,000 labeled examples -- less than 1% of conventional approaches. ALMA generates large amounts of high-quality synthetic alignment data through new techniques: diverse prompt synthesis via few-shot learning, diverse response generation with multiple model checkpoints, and judge (reward model) enhancement through score aggregation and self-distillation. Using only a pretrained Llama3 base model, 5,000 SFT examples, and 4,000 judge annotations, ALMA achieves performance close to Llama3-Instruct across diverse alignment benchmarks (e.g., 0.1% difference on AlpacaEval 2.0 score). These results are achieved with a multi-round, self-bootstrapped data synthesis and training recipe that continues to improve for 10 rounds, surpassing the typical 3-round ceiling of previous methods. These results suggest that base models already possess sufficient knowledge for effective alignment, and that synthetic data generation methods can expose it.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model unlearning has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to address security and privacy concerns, leading to extensive research in the field. However, much of this research has concentrated on instance-level unlearning, specifically targeting the removal of predefined instances containing sensitive content. This focus has left a significant gap in the exploration of full entity-level unlearning, which is critical in real-world scenarios such as copyright protection. To this end, we propose a novel task of Entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase entity-related knowledge from the target model completely. To thoroughly investigate this task, we systematically evaluate trending unlearning algorithms, revealing that current methods struggle to achieve effective entity-level unlearning. Then, we further explore the factors that influence the performance of the unlearning algorithms, identifying that knowledge coverage and the size of the forget set play pivotal roles. Notably, our analysis also uncovers that entities introduced through fine-tuning are more vulnerable to unlearning than pre-trained entities. These findings collectively offer valuable insights for advancing entity-level unlearning for LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements have highlighted that large language models (LLMs), when given a small set of task-specific examples, demonstrate remarkable proficiency, a capability that extends to complex reasoning tasks. In particular, the combination of few-shot learning with the chain-of-thought (CoT) approach has been pivotal in steering models towards more logically consistent conclusions. This paper explores the optimization of example selection for designing effective CoT pre-prompts and shows that the choice of the optimization algorithm, typically in favor of comparison-based methods such as evolutionary computation, significantly enhances efficacy and feasibility. Specifically, thanks to a limited exploitative and overfitted optimization, Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) brings an improvement over the naive few-shot approach exceeding 10 absolute points in exact match scores on benchmark datasets such as GSM8k and MathQA. These gains are consistent across various contexts and are further amplified when integrated with self-consistency (SC)

To address this, we propose a neural network (NN) based framework integrated with an approximate Gaussian process to manage spatial interference and unobserved confounding. Additionally, we adopt a generalized propensity-score-based approach to address partially observed outcomes when estimating causal effects with continuous treatments. We evaluate our framework using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data inferred from satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that NN-based models significantly outperform linear spatial regression models in estimating causal effects. Furthermore, in real-world case studies, NN-based models offer more reasonable predictions of causal effects, facilitating decision-making in relevant applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In multi-agent systems, the agent behavior is highly influenced by its utility function, as these utilities shape both individual goals as well as interactions with the other agents. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a well-established approach to inferring the utility function by observing an expert behavior within a given environment. In this paper, we extend the IRL framework to the multi-agent setting, assuming to observe agents who are following Nash Equilibrium (NE) policies. We theoretically investigate the set of utilities that explain the behavior of NE experts. Specifically, we provide an explicit characterization of the feasible reward set and analyze how errors in estimating the transition dynamics and expert behavior impact the recovered rewards. Building on these findings, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the multi-agent IRL problem. Finally, we provide a numerical evaluation of our theoretical results.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive results in multiple domains of natural language processing (NLP) but are mainly focused on the English language. Recently, more LLMs have incorporated a larger proportion of multilingual text to represent low-resource languages. In Arabic NLP, several Arabic-centric LLMs have shown remarkable results on multiple benchmarks in the past two years. However, most Arabic LLMs have more than 7 billion parameters, which increases their hardware requirements and inference latency, when compared to smaller LLMs. This paper introduces Arabic Stable LM 1.6B in a base and chat version as a small but powerful Arabic-centric LLM. Our Arabic Stable LM 1.6B chat model achieves impressive results on several benchmarks beating multiple models with up to 8x the parameters. In addition, we show the benefit of mixing in synthetic instruction tuning data by augmenting our fine-tuning data with a large synthetic dialogue dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, the text-to-3D task has developed rapidly due to the appearance of the SDS method. However, the SDS method always generates 3D objects with poor quality due to the over-smooth issue. This issue is attributed to two factors: 1) the DDPM single-step inference produces poor guidance gradients; 2) the randomness from the input noises and timesteps averages the details of the 3D contents. In this paper, to address the issue, we propose DreamLCM which incorporates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM). DreamLCM leverages the powerful image generation capabilities inherent in LCM, enabling generating consistent and high-quality guidance, i.e., predicted noises or images. Powered by the improved guidance, the proposed method can provide accurate and detailed gradients to optimize the target 3D models. In addition, we propose two strategies to enhance the generation quality further. Firstly, we propose a guidance calibration strategy, utilizing Euler Solver to calibrate the guidance distribution to accelerate 3D models to converge. Secondly, we propose a dual timestep strategy, increasing the consistency of guidance and optimizing 3D models from geometry to appearance in DreamLCM. Experiments show that DreamLCM achieves state-of-the-art results in both generation quality and training efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/1YimingZhong/DreamLCM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents ClinicSum, a novel framework designed to automatically generate clinical summaries from patient-doctor conversations. It utilizes a two-module architecture: a retrieval-based filtering module that extracts Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) information from conversation transcripts, and an inference module powered by fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), which leverage the extracted SOAP data to generate abstracted clinical summaries. To fine-tune the PLM, we created a training dataset of consisting 1,473 conversations-summaries pair by consolidating two publicly available datasets, FigShare and MTS-Dialog, with ground truth summaries validated by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). ClinicSum's effectiveness is evaluated through both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and expert human assessments. Results show that ClinicSum outperforms state-of-the-art PLMs, demonstrating superior precision, recall, and F-1 scores in automatic evaluations and receiving high preference from SMEs in human assessment, making it a robust solution for automated clinical summarization.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel method ($floZ$), based on normalizing flows, to estimate the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a pre-existing set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples and their likelihood from the unnormalized posterior density. As a physical application, we use $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for layout generation due to their ability to produce structure-description languages, such as HTML or JSON, even without access to visual information. Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with the Gemini. Without any additional training, VASCAR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality outperforming both existing layout-specific generative models and other LLM-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z > 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The emergence and growth of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks has brought about the rise of so-called "programmable" networks, i.e., networks whose operational requirements are so stringent that they can only be met in an automated manner, with minimal/no human involvement. Any requirements on such a network would need to be formally specified via intents, which can represent user requirements in a formal yet understandable manner. Meeting the user requirements via intents would necessitate the rapid implementation of resource allocation and scheduling in the network. Also, given the expected size and geographical distribution of programmable networks, multiple resource scheduling implementations would need to be implemented at the same time. This would necessitate the use of a meta-scheduler that can coordinate the various schedulers and dynamically ensure optimal resource scheduling across the network.   To that end, in this position paper, we propose a research agenda for modeling, implementation, and inclusion of intent-based dynamic meta-scheduling in programmable networks. Our research agenda will be built on active inference, a type of causal inference. Active inference provides some level of autonomy to each scheduler while the meta-scheduler takes care of overall intent fulfillment. Our research agenda will comprise a strawman architecture for meta-scheduling and a set of research questions that need to be addressed to make intent-dynamic meta-scheduling a reality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Molecular docking is a crucial step in drug development, which enables the virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library increases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce the Bias-free Extragalactic Analysis for Cosmic Origins with NIRCam (BEACON) survey, a JWST Cycle2 program allocated up to 600 pure-parallel hours of observations. BEACON explores high-latitude areas of the sky with JWST/NIRCam over $\sim100$ independent sightlines, totaling $\sim0.3$deg$^2$, reaching a median F444W depth of $\approx28.2$AB mag (5$\sigma$). Based on existing JWST observations in legacy fields, we estimate that BEACON will photometrically identify 25--150 galaxies at $z>10$ and 500--1000 at $z\sim7$--10 uniquely enabled by an efficient multiple filter configuration spanning $0.9$--5.0$\mu$m. The expected sample size of $z>10$ galaxies will allow us to obtain robust number density estimates and to discriminate between different models of early star formation. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey design and initial results using the first 19 fields. We present 129 galaxy candidates at $z>7$ identified in those fields, including 11 galaxies at $z>10$ and several UV-luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-21$mag) galaxies at $z\sim8$. The number densities of $z<13$ galaxies inferred from the initial fields are overall consistent with those in the literature. Despite reaching a considerably large volume ($\sim10^5$Mpc$^3$), however, we find no galaxy candidates at $z>13$, providing us with a complimentary insight into early galaxy evolution with minimal cosmic variance. We publish imaging and catalog data products for these initial fields. Upon survey completion, all BEACON data will be coherently processed and distributed to the community along with catalogs for redshift and other physical quantities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Effective communication is fundamental to any interaction, yet challenges arise when participants do not share a common language. Automatic translation systems offer a powerful solution to bridge language barriers in such scenarios, but they introduce errors that can lead to misunderstandings and conversation breakdown. A key issue is that current systems fail to incorporate the rich contextual information necessary to resolve ambiguities and omitted details, resulting in literal, inappropriate, or misaligned translations. In this work, we present a framework to improve large language model-based translation systems by incorporating contextual information in bilingual conversational settings. During training, we leverage context-augmented parallel data, which allows the model to generate translations sensitive to conversational history. During inference, we perform quality-aware decoding with context-aware metrics to select the optimal translation from a pool of candidates. We validate both components of our framework on two task-oriented domains: customer chat and user-assistant interaction. Across both settings, our framework consistently results in better translations than state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4o and TowerInstruct, as measured by multiple automatic translation quality metrics on several language pairs. We also show that the resulting model leverages context in an intended and interpretable way, improving consistency between the conveyed message and the generated translations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties are under-served by language technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). This trend threatens to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limits language modeling applications, yet the research community lacks operationalized LLM performance measurements in DA. We present a method that comprehensively evaluates LLM fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia in modeling DA. We evaluate nine LLMs in eight DA varieties across these four dimensions and provide best practice recommendations. Our evaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it, but does not suggest deterioration in quality when they do. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can degrade DA capabilities, that few-shot examples can overcome this and other LLM deficiencies, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate well with LLM DA performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for the global fitting of all resolvable sources, as well as the astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave signals. However, such analyses usually entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we explore the application of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) on the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Specifically, we employ linear interpolation and trig interpolation methods to construct transport paths for training CNFs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within CNFs, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using CNFs. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Over the past few decades, the process and methodology of automated question generation (AQG) have undergone significant transformations. Recent progress in generative natural language models has opened up new potential in the generation of educational content.   Objectives: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating computer science questions that are sufficiently annotated for automatic learner model updates, are fully situated in the context of a particular course, and address the cognitive dimension understand.   Methods: Unlike previous attempts that might use basic methods like ChatGPT, our approach involves more targeted strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful learning objects.   Results and Conclusions: Our results show that generating structural, semantic annotations works well. However, this success was not reflected in the case of relational annotations. The quality of the generated questions often did not meet educational standards, highlighting that although LLMs can contribute to the pool of learning materials, their current level of performance requires significant human intervention to refine and validate the generated content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various tasks, but deploying them for inference poses challenges. Their high resource demands often necessitate complex, costly multi-GPU pipelines, or the use of smaller, less capable models. While quantization offers a promising solution utilizing lower precision for model storage, existing methods frequently experience significant performance drops at lower precision levels. Additionally, they typically provide only a limited set of solutions at specific bit levels, many of which are extensively manually tuned. To address these challenges, we propose a new method called SKIM: Scaled K-means clustering wIth Mixed precision. Our approach introduces two novel techniques: 1. A greedy algorithm to solve approximately optimal bit allocation across weight channels, and 2. A trainable scaling vector for non-differentiable K-means clustering. These techniques substantially improve performance and can be adapted to any given bit. Notably, in terms of model perplexity, our method narrows the gap between 3-bit quantized LLaMA models and their full precision counterparts by 16.3% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recently, there has been an increasing interest in performing post-hoc uncertainty estimation about the predictions of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Given a pre-trained DNN via back-propagation, these methods enhance the original network by adding output confidence measures, such as error bars, without compromising its initial accuracy. In this context, we introduce a novel family of sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs), where the posterior mean is fixed to any continuous function when using a universal kernel. Specifically, we fix the mean of this GP to the output of the pre-trained DNN, allowing our approach to effectively fit the GP's predictive variances to estimate the DNN prediction uncertainty. Our approach leverages variational inference (VI) for efficient stochastic optimization, with training costs that remain independent of the number of training points, scaling efficiently to large datasets such as ImageNet. The proposed method, called fixed mean GP (FMGP), is architecture-agnostic, relying solely on the pre-trained model's outputs to adjust the predictive variances. Experimental results demonstrate that FMGP improves both uncertainty estimation and computational efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are key technologies driving intelligent systems to handle multiple tasks. To meet the demands of various tasks, an increasing number of LLMs-driven experts with diverse capabilities have been developed, accompanied by corresponding benchmarks to evaluate their performance. This paper proposes the Bench-CoE framework, which enables Collaboration of Experts (CoE) by effectively leveraging benchmark evaluations to achieve optimal performance across various tasks. Bench-CoE includes a set of expert models, a router for assigning tasks to corresponding experts, and a benchmark dataset for training the router. Moreover, we formulate Query-Level and Subject-Level approaches based on our framework, and analyze the merits and drawbacks of these two approaches. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments with vary data distributions on both language and multimodal tasks to validate that our proposed Bench-CoE outperforms any single model in terms of overall performance. We hope this method serves as a baseline for further research in this area. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ZhangXJ199/Bench-CoE}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> One of the main goals of physics education is to develop in students the ability to think critically about data and scientific models. This skill is key in everyday life, as it allows one to interpret data accurately, evaluate whether conclusions are based on evidence, and distinguish between meaningful patterns and random occurrences. Although "correlation does not imply causation" it is common to make mistakes when interpreting relationships between variables, either due to bias or the human tendency to seek causal explanations. The history of science is filled with examples where causality was incorrectly inferred from correlation. In today's society, with the rise of fake news, misinterpretation, and data manipulation, educating students about scientific reasoning is more important than ever. In this paper, we present an activity aimed at high school physics students as part of an introductory module on scientific work. The learning objectives of this activity are to adequately plot a set of data, to extract relevant information from these data, and to clearly distinguish between correlation and causation. A brief overview of some types of correlation that do not imply causation follows, followed by a description of the activity, the results obtained, and finally the conclusions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Fusing Events and RGB images for object detection leverages the robustness of Event cameras in adverse environments and the rich semantic information provided by RGB cameras. However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events \textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training \textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the high-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{F}requency-\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with high-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal style and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further propose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the prediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original representation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This strategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary reference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information, retaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency detection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs demonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher inference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD achieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD achieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB data with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even maintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\times$ Event-RGB frequency mismatch.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Cascade systems, consisting of a lightweight model processing all samples and a heavier, high-accuracy model refining challenging samples, have become a widely-adopted distributed inference approach to achieving high accuracy and maintaining a low computational burden for mobile and IoT devices. As intelligent indoor environments, like smart homes, continue to expand, a new scenario emerges, the multi-device cascade. In this setting, multiple diverse devices simultaneously utilize a shared heavy model hosted on a server, often situated within or close to the consumer environment. This work introduces MultiTASC++, a continuously adaptive multi-tenancy-aware scheduler that dynamically controls the forwarding decision functions of devices to optimize system throughput while maintaining high accuracy and low latency. Through extensive experimentation in diverse device environments and with varying server-side models, we demonstrate the scheduler's efficacy in consistently maintaining a targeted satisfaction rate while providing the highest available accuracy across different device tiers and workloads of up to 100 devices. This demonstrates its scalability and efficiency in addressing the unique challenges of collaborative DNN inference in dynamic and diverse IoT environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities beyond language generation to interact with external systems through tool calling, offering powerful potential for real-world applications. However, the phenomenon of tool hallucinations, which occur when models improperly select or misuse tools, presents critical challenges that can lead to flawed task execution and increased operational costs. This paper investigates the concept of reliable tool calling and highlights the necessity of addressing tool hallucinations. We systematically categorize tool hallucinations into two main types: tool selection hallucination and tool usage hallucination. To mitigate these issues, we propose a reliability-focused alignment framework that enhances the model's ability to accurately assess tool relevance and usage. By proposing a suite of evaluation metrics and evaluating on StableToolBench, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating tool hallucination and improving the overall system reliability of LLM tool calling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance} mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust} model behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become a critical objective of model developers. In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical processes, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies often rely on numerical solvers or machine learning-based surrogate models to solve or accelerate these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each responsible for evolving a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, no universal algorithm exists for multi-component simulations, which adds to the complexity. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component Simulation with Diffusion models (MultiSimDiff) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, MultiSimDiff learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, MultiSimDiff generates coupled multiphysics solutions and multi-component structures by sampling from the joint probability distribution, achieved by composing the learned energy functions in a structured way. We test our method in three tasks. In the reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling problems, MultiSimDiff successfully predicts the coupling solution using decoupled data, while the surrogate model fails in the more complex second problem. For the thermal and mechanical analysis of the prismatic fuel element, MultiSimDiff trained for single component prediction accurately predicts a larger structure with 64 components, reducing the relative error by 40.3% compared to the surrogate model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we examine the impact of lexicalization on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD). It is well known that one of the key challenges in interpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging the lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct vocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is explicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect to the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the performance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA system that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner to infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that such a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current QA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score compared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and potential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that LLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal improvements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that LLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of the meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken together, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the importance of lexicalization and compositionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success across various multi-modal tasks, yet large VLMs encounter significant efficiency challenges due to processing numerous visual tokens. A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains comparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps from all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce a \textbf{training-free} method, \underline{\textbf{S}}mall VLM \underline{\textbf{G}}uidance for accelerating \underline{\textbf{L}}arge VLMs (\textbf{SGL}). Specifically, we employ the attention map aggregated from a small VLM to guide visual token pruning in a large VLM. Additionally, an early exiting mechanism is developed to fully use the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computation. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SGL, achieving up to 91\% pruning ratio for visual tokens while retaining competitive performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful but computationally intensive method for simulating physical phenomena. Recent advancements in machine learning have led to surrogate models capable of accelerating FEA. Yet there are still limitations in developing surrogates of transient FEA models that can simultaneously predict the solutions for both nodes and elements with applicability on both the 2D and 3D domains. Motivated by this research gap, this study proposes DeepFEA, a deep learning-based framework that leverages a multilayer Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network branching into two parallel convolutional neural networks to predict the solutions for both nodes and elements of FEA models. The proposed network is optimized using a novel adaptive learning algorithm, called Node-Element Loss Optimization (NELO). NELO minimizes the error occurring at both branches of the network enabling the prediction of solutions for transient FEA simulations. The experimental evaluation of DeepFEA is performed on three datasets in the context of structural mechanics, generated to serve as publicly available reference datasets. The results show that DeepFEA can achieve less than 3% normalized mean and root mean squared error for 2D and 3D simulation scenarios, and inference times that are two orders of magnitude faster than FEA. In contrast, relevant state-of-the-art methods face challenges with multi-dimensional output and dynamic input prediction. Furthermore, DeepFEA's robustness was demonstrated in a real-life biomedical scenario, confirming its suitability for accurate and efficient predictions of FEA simulations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for principal stratification, leveraging the dependent Dirichlet process to flexibly model the distribution of potential outcomes. By incorporating confounders and potential outcomes for the post-treatment variable in the Bayesian mixture model for the final outcome, our approach improves the accuracy of missing data imputation and allows for the characterization of treatment effects across strata defined based on the values of the post-treatment variable. We assess the performance of our method through a Monte Carlo simulation study where we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art Bayesian method in principal stratification. Finally, we leverage the proposed method to evaluate the principal causal effects of exposure to air pollution on social mobility in the US on strata defined by educational attainment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Photonics has unlocked the potential for energy-efficient acceleration of deep learning. Most approaches toward photonic deep learning have diligently reproduced traditional deep learning architectures using photonic platforms, separately implementing linear-optical matrix calculations and nonlinear activations via electro-optical conversion, optical nonlinearities, and signal-encoded materials. Here we propose a concept of nonlinear unitary photonic circuits to achieve the integration of linear and nonlinear expressivity essential for deep neural networks. We devise a building block for two-dimensional nonlinear unitary operations, featuring norm-preserving mappings with nonconservative inner products, which enables the construction of high-dimensional nonlinear unitary circuits. Using deep nonlinear unitary circuits, we demonstrate exponential growth in trajectory length and near-complete coverage of the output space, both of which are essential for deep learning. Along with neuroevolutionary learning examples for the regression of a nonconvex function, our results pave the way to photonic neural networks with highly expressive inference and stable training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose utilizing background operators for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we define a set of fundamental mathematical predicates as the basic building blocks. For each mathematical problem, we develop a Prolog solution that includes problem-specific predicates and intermediate predicates derived from these background operators, ensuring that each solution adheres to the defined operator set. We introduce the MATH-Prolog corpus, which is derived from the counting and probability categories of the MATH corpus. For efficient data augmentation, we apply K-fold cross-validated self-training. This method incrementally generates new Prolog solutions for each fold, incorporating those verified as correct into the training set throughout the model training process. Our experimental results demonstrate that 5-fold crossvalidated self-training effectively identifies new, accurate Prolog solutions, achieving an accuracy of 84.6% on the cross-validated set, and 84.8% on the test set during fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. This approach successfully uncovers new solutions with fully computable inference steps for previously unseen problems. Additionally, incorporating the background mathematical predicates into the prompt enhances solution coverage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a one-stage framework for real-time multi-person 3D human mesh estimation from a single RGB image. While current one-stage methods, which follow a DETR-style pipeline, achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-resolution inputs, we observe that this particularly benefits the estimation of individuals in smaller scales of the image (e.g., those far from the camera), but at the cost of significantly increased computation overhead. To address this, we introduce scale-adaptive tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on the relative scale of each individual in the image within the DETR framework. Specifically, individuals in smaller scales are processed at higher resolutions, larger ones at lower resolutions, and background regions are further distilled. These scale-adaptive tokens more efficiently encode the image features, facilitating subsequent decoding to regress the human mesh, while allowing the model to allocate computational resources more effectively and focus on more challenging cases. Experiments show that our method preserves the accuracy benefits of high-resolution processing while substantially reducing computational cost, achieving real-time inference with performance comparable to SOTA methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to model the sequential dependencies in users' historical interactions to better capture their evolving interests. However, existing SR approaches primarily rely on collaborative data, which leads to limitations such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), their application in industrial recommender systems is hindered by high inference latency, inability to capture all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) paradigm to empower recommendation models with LLMs. Specifically, we first pre-train both the SR and LLM models to get collaborative and textual embeddings. Next, a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss is proposed using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Finally, a triple-experts architecture, consisting aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PAD, showing significant improvements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, especially on cold items. The implementation code and datasets will be publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the strength of Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown over recent years, so too has interest in their use as the underlying models for autonomous agents. Although LLMs demonstrate emergent abilities and broad expertise across natural language domains, their inherent unpredictability makes the implementation of LLM agents challenging, resulting in a gap between related research and the real-world implementation of such systems. To bridge this gap, this paper frames actionable insights and considerations from the research community in the context of established application paradigms to enable the construction and facilitate the informed deployment of robust LLM agents. Namely, we position relevant research findings into four broad categories--Planning, Memory, Tools, and Control Flow--based on common practices in application-focused literature and highlight practical considerations to make when designing agentic LLMs for real-world applications, such as handling stochasticity and managing resources efficiently. While we do not conduct empirical evaluations, we do provide the necessary background for discussing critical aspects of agentic LLM designs, both in academia and industry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Particle velocimetry is essential in solid fuel combustion studies, however, the accurate detection and tracking of particles in high Particle Number Density (PND) combustion scenario remain challenging. The current study advances the machine-learning approaches for precise velocity measurements of solid particles. For this, laser imaging experiments were performed for high-volatile bituminous coal particles burning in a laminar flow reactor. Particle positions were imaged using time-resolved Mie scattering. Various detection methods, including conventional blob detection and Machine Learning (ML) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Realtime Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) were employed and bench marked.~Particle tracking was performed using the Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. The results demonstrated the capability of machine learning models trained on low-PND data for prediction of high-PND data. Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) algorithm is important for the better performance of the used models. By evaluating the velocity statistics, it is found that the mean particle velocity decreases with increasing PND, primarily due to stronger particle interactions. The particle dynamics are closely related to the position of combustion zone observed in the previous study. Thus, PND is considered as the dominant factor for the particle group combustion behavior of high-volatile solid fuels.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss. which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/lbc12345/LossAgent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Accurately generating images of human bodies from text remains a challenging problem for state of the art text-to-image models. Commonly observed body-related artifacts include extra or missing limbs, unrealistic poses, blurred body parts, etc. Currently, evaluation of such artifacts relies heavily on time-consuming human judgments, limiting the ability to benchmark models at scale. We address this by proposing BodyMetric, a learnable metric that predicts body realism in images. BodyMetric is trained on realism labels and multi-modal signals including 3D body representations inferred from the input image, and textual descriptions. In order to facilitate this approach, we design an annotation pipeline to collect expert ratings on human body realism leading to a new dataset for this task, namely, BodyRealism. Ablation studies support our architectural choices for BodyMetric and the importance of leveraging a 3D human body prior in capturing body-related artifacts in 2D images. In comparison to concurrent metrics which evaluate general user preference in images, BodyMetric specifically reflects body-related artifacts. We demonstrate the utility of BodyMetric through applications that were previously infeasible at scale. In particular, we use BodyMetric to benchmark the generation ability of text-to-image models to produce realistic human bodies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of BodyMetric in ranking generated images based on the predicted realism scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Transformer-based models generate hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to interpret these hidden states and control them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probes to measure neural collapse towards interpretable motion features in hidden states. High probing accuracy implies meaningful directions and distances between hidden states of opposing features, which we use to fit interpretable control vectors for activation steering at inference. To optimize our control vectors, we use sparse autoencoders with fully-connected, convolutional, MLPMixer layers and various activation functions. Notably, we show that enforcing sparsity in hidden states leads to a more linear relationship between control vector temperatures and forecasts. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretability and zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.

Even though prior works utilize language knowledge for recognition, such approaches exhibit limited interactions between language-image modalities. Our approach primarily focuses on enhancing the inter-modality interactions through fostering richer interactions between image and textual data. Additionally, we introduce a novel module aimed at alleviating the computational burden associated with exhaustive exploration of all possible compositions during the inference stage. While previous methods exclusively learn compositions jointly or independently, we introduce an advanced hybrid procedure that leverages both learning mechanisms to generate final predictions. Our proposed model, achieves state-of-the-art in OW-CZSL in three datasets, while surpassing Large Vision Language Models (LLVM) in two datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> With increasing numbers of vulnerabilities exposed on the internet, autonomous penetration testing (pentesting) has emerged as an emerging research area, while reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for studying autonomous pentesting. Previous research in RL-based autonomous pentesting mainly focused on enhancing agents' learning efficacy within abstract simulated training environments. They overlooked the applicability and generalization requirements of deploying agents' policies in real-world environments that differ substantially from their training settings. In contrast, for the first time, we shift focus to the pentesting agents' ability to generalize across unseen real environments. For this purpose, we propose a Generalizable Autonomous Pentesting framework (namely GAP) for training agents capable of drawing inferences from one to another -- a key requirement for the broad application of autonomous pentesting and a hallmark of human intelligence. GAP introduces a Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipeline with two key methods: domain randomization and meta-RL learning. Specifically, we are among the first to apply domain randomization in autonomous pentesting and propose a large language model-powered domain randomization method for synthetic environment generation. We further apply meta-RL to improve the agents' generalization ability in unseen environments by leveraging the synthetic environments. The combination of these two methods can effectively bridge the generalization gap and improve policy adaptation performance. Experiments are conducted on various vulnerable virtual machines, with results showing that GAP can (a) enable policy learning in unknown real environments, (b) achieve zero-shot policy transfer in similar environments, and (c) realize rapid policy adaptation in dissimilar environments.

Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless, existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components, we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights, we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (SoRA), an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoRA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Furthermore, we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy, thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoRA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection. In addition, our methods introduce no additional inference overhead or regularization loss, maintain compatibility with any backbone or head, and are designed to be versatile, allowing easy integration into a wide range of tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The properties of the entire neutron star population can be inferred by modeling their evolution, from birth to the present, through pulsar population synthesis. This involves simulating a mock population, applying observational filters, and comparing the resulting sources to the limited subset of detected pulsars. We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic isolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio luminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based inference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior estimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on simulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the underlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space by concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data thus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate the efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE), achieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with previous studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE approaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron stars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars' intrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to the neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio luminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g'r'i'z'JHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating program code, opening exciting opportunities for applying program synthesis to games. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, but their output may not be aligned with the user or even produce harmful content. This paper presents a novel approach to detect and steer concepts such as toxicity before generation. We introduce the Sparse Conditioned Autoencoder (SCAR), a single trained module that extends the otherwise untouched LLM. SCAR ensures full steerability, towards and away from concepts (e.g., toxic content), without compromising the quality of the model's text generation on standard evaluation benchmarks. We demonstrate the effective application of our approach through a variety of concepts, including toxicity, safety, and writing style alignment. As such, this work establishes a robust framework for controlling LLM generations, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social interactions are fundamental to human life. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs)-based virtual assistants has demonstrated their potential to revolutionize human interactions and lifestyles. However, existing assistive systems mainly provide reactive services to individual users, rather than offering in-situ assistance during live social interactions with conversational partners. In this study, we introduce SocialMind, the first LLM-based proactive AR social assistive system that provides users with in-situ social assistance. SocialMind employs human-like perception leveraging multi-modal sensors to extract both verbal and nonverbal cues, social factors, and implicit personas, incorporating these social cues into LLM reasoning for social suggestion generation. Additionally, SocialMind employs a multi-tier collaborative generation strategy and proactive update mechanism to display social suggestions on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, ensuring that suggestions are timely provided to users without disrupting the natural flow of conversation. Evaluations on three public datasets and a user study with 20 participants show that SocialMind achieves 38.3% higher engagement compared to baselines, and 95% of participants are willing to use SocialMind in their live social interactions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The agents in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) make observations about the system and send that information to a fusion center. The fusion center aggregates the information and concludes about the system parameters with as much accuracy as possible. However for the purposes of better efficiency of the system at large, the agents need to append some private parameters to the observed data. In this scenario, the data sent to the fusion center is faced with privacy risks. The data communicated to the fusion center must be secured against data privacy breaches and inference attacks in a decentralized manner. However, this in turn leads to a loss of utility of the data being sent to the fusion center. We quantify the utility and privacy of the system using Cosine similarity. We formulate our MAS problem in terms of deducing a concept for which compression-based methods are there in literature. Next, we propose a novel sanitization mechanism for our MAS using one such compression-based method while addressing the utility-privacy tradeoff problem.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the importance of extending context lengths for handling complex tasks. While traditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long documents, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model performance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation (Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed. However, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both aspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating semantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to predict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar queries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior performance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context lengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> A core problem in statistics and probabilistic machine learning is to compute probability distributions and expectations. This is the fundamental problem of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which frames all inference as expectations with respect to the posterior distribution. The key challenge is to approximate these intractable expectations. In this tutorial, we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), a random-sampling-based class of methods for approximate inference. First, we explain the basics of SMC, discuss practical issues, and review theoretical results. We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the SMC estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation. Throughout the tutorial we illustrate the use of SMC on various models commonly used in machine learning, such as stochastic recurrent neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, and probabilistic programs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We study the problem of bounding the posterior distribution of discrete probabilistic programs with unbounded support, loops, and conditioning. Loops pose the main difficulty in this setting: even if exact Bayesian inference is possible, the state of the art requires user-provided loop invariant templates. By contrast, we aim to find guaranteed bounds, which sandwich the true distribution. They are fully automated, applicable to more programs and provide more provable guarantees than approximate sampling-based inference. Since lower bounds can be obtained by unrolling loops, the main challenge is upper bounds, and we attack it in two ways. The first is called residual mass semantics, which is a flat bound based on the residual probability mass of a loop. The approach is simple, efficient, and has provable guarantees.   The main novelty of our work is the second approach, called geometric bound semantics. It operates on a novel family of distributions, called eventually geometric distributions (EGDs), and can bound the distribution of loops with a new form of loop invariants called contraction invariants. The invariant synthesis problem reduces to a system of polynomial inequality constraints, which is a decidable problem with automated solvers. If a solution exists, it yields an exponentially decreasing bound on the whole distribution, and can therefore bound moments and tail asymptotics as well, not just probabilities as in the first approach.   Both semantics enjoy desirable theoretical properties. In particular, we prove soundness and convergence, i.e. the bounds converge to the exact posterior as loops are unrolled further. On the practical side, we describe Diabolo, a fully-automated implementation of both semantics, and evaluate them on a variety of benchmarks from the literature, demonstrating their general applicability and the utility of the resulting bounds.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years; however, their excellent performance is still largely limited to major world languages, primarily English. Many LLMs continue to face challenges with multilingual tasks, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduced Marco-LLM: Massive multilingual training for cross-lingual enhancement LLM. We have collected a substantial amount of multilingual data for several low-resource languages and conducted extensive continual pre-training using the Qwen2 models. This effort has resulted in a multilingual LLM named Marco-LLM. Through comprehensive evaluations on various multilingual benchmarks, including MMMLU, AGIEval, Belebele, Flores-200, XCOPA and many others, Marco-LLM has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, Marco-LLM achieved substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks, showing the effectiveness of our multilingual LLM. Marco-LLM is a pioneering multilingual LLM designed to not only perform exceptionally well in multilingual tasks, including low-resource languages, but also maintain strong performance in English and other major languages, closing the performance gap between high- and low-resource language capabilities. By bridging languages, this effort demonstrates our dedication to ensuring LLMs work accurately across various languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Numerous crucial tasks in real-world decision-making rely on machine learning algorithms with calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in unifying image comprehension and generation within Large Language Models (LLMs). This growing interest has prompted us to explore extending this unification to videos. The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs, and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work, we introduce Divot, a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer, which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition, then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally, the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer, decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer, we present Divot-Vicuna through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer, when integrated with a pre-trained LLM, achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks. The instruction tuned Divot-Vicuna also excels in video storytelling, generating interleaved narratives and corresponding videos.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a generative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the effectiveness of data selection for large language models (LLMs) during pretraining and instruction fine-tuning phases, improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have transformed human-computer interactions by enabling seamless, natural, and context-aware communication. While these advancements offer immense utility, they also inherit and amplify inherent safety risks such as bias, fairness, hallucinations, privacy breaches, and a lack of transparency. This paper investigates a critical vulnerability: adversarial attacks targeting the LLM core within AI agents. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that a deceptively simple adversarial prefix, such as \textit{Ignore the document}, can compel LLMs to produce dangerous or unintended outputs by bypassing their contextual safeguards. Through experimentation, we demonstrate a high attack success rate (ASR), revealing the fragility of existing LLM defenses. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust, multi-layered security measures tailored to mitigate vulnerabilities at the LLM level and within broader agent-based architectures.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in many long-context tasks. However, due to high annotation costs, high-quality long-context summary datasets for training or evaluation are scarce, limiting further research. In this work, we introduce CNNSum, a new multi-scale Chinese long-context novel summarization benchmark, including four subsets, length covering 16k\textasciitilde128k, 695 samples in total, the annotations are human-driven. We evaluate commercial and open-source models on CNNSum and conduct a detailed analysis. Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration with short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due to excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths are the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context summaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a large performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned Chat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning cannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit strong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when combined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare applications offers promising advancements in medical diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care. However, the susceptibility of LLMs to adversarial attacks poses a significant threat, potentially leading to harmful outcomes in delicate medical contexts. This study investigates the vulnerability of LLMs to two types of adversarial attacks in three medical tasks. Utilizing real-world patient data, we demonstrate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs are susceptible to manipulation across multiple tasks. This research further reveals that domain-specific tasks demand more adversarial data in model fine-tuning than general domain tasks for effective attack execution, especially for more capable models. We discover that while integrating adversarial data does not markedly degrade overall model performance on medical benchmarks, it does lead to noticeable shifts in fine-tuned model weights, suggesting a potential pathway for detecting and countering model attacks. This research highlights the urgent need for robust security measures and the development of defensive mechanisms to safeguard LLMs in medical applications, to ensure their safe and effective deployment in healthcare settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Due to the significant time and effort required for handcrafting translations, most manga never leave the domestic Japanese market. Automatic manga translation is a promising potential solution. However, it is a budding and underdeveloped field and presents complexities even greater than those found in standard translation due to the need to effectively incorporate visual elements into the translation process to resolve ambiguities. In this work, we investigate to what extent multimodal large language models (LLMs) can provide effective manga translation, thereby assisting manga authors and publishers in reaching wider audiences. Specifically, we propose a methodology that leverages the vision component of multimodal LLMs to improve translation quality and evaluate the impact of translation unit size, context length, and propose a token efficient approach for manga translation. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation dataset -- the first parallel Japanese-Polish manga translation dataset -- as part of a benchmark to be used in future research. Finally, we contribute an open-source software suite, enabling others to benchmark LLMs for manga translation. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results for Japanese-English translation and set a new standard for Japanese-Polish.

While now standard, it is tricky to implement effective guardrails to collect high-quality annotations from humans. In this paper, we demonstrate that three sources of bad annotations, both malicious and otherwise, can corrupt the reliability of open leaderboard rankings. In particular, we show that only 10\% of poor quality votes by apathetic (site visitors not appropriately incentivized to give correct votes) or adversarial (bad actors seeking to inflate the ranking of a target model) annotators can change the rankings of models by up to 5 places on the leaderboard. Finally, we discuss open challenges in ensuring high-quality human annotations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> While motion generation has made substantial progress, its practical application remains constrained by dataset diversity and scale, limiting its ability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this, we propose a simple and effective baseline, RMD, which enhances the generalization of motion generation through retrieval-augmented techniques. Unlike previous retrieval-based methods, RMD requires no additional training and offers three key advantages: (1) the external retrieval database can be flexibly replaced; (2) body parts from the motion database can be reused, with an LLM facilitating splitting and recombination; and (3) a pre-trained motion diffusion model serves as a prior to improve the quality of motions obtained through retrieval and direct combination. Without any training, RMD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable advantages on out-of-distribution data.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance models' MT ability. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 79K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from different languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.58-3.09 BLEU and 1.00-2.03 COMET scores.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released.

In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate on a variety of realistic simulated locomotion tasks with a quadruped robot.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment. All source code and the dataset will be made available on GitHub.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent approaches to large language model (LLM) alignment typically require millions of human annotations or rely on external aligned models for synthetic data generation. This paper introduces ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation, demonstrating that effective alignment can be achieved using only 9,000 labeled examples -- less than 1% of conventional approaches. ALMA generates large amounts of high-quality synthetic alignment data through new techniques: diverse prompt synthesis via few-shot learning, diverse response generation with multiple model checkpoints, and judge (reward model) enhancement through score aggregation and self-distillation. Using only a pretrained Llama3 base model, 5,000 SFT examples, and 4,000 judge annotations, ALMA achieves performance close to Llama3-Instruct across diverse alignment benchmarks (e.g., 0.1% difference on AlpacaEval 2.0 score). These results are achieved with a multi-round, self-bootstrapped data synthesis and training recipe that continues to improve for 10 rounds, surpassing the typical 3-round ceiling of previous methods. These results suggest that base models already possess sufficient knowledge for effective alignment, and that synthetic data generation methods can expose it.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language model unlearning has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to address security and privacy concerns, leading to extensive research in the field. However, much of this research has concentrated on instance-level unlearning, specifically targeting the removal of predefined instances containing sensitive content. This focus has left a significant gap in the exploration of full entity-level unlearning, which is critical in real-world scenarios such as copyright protection. To this end, we propose a novel task of Entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase entity-related knowledge from the target model completely. To thoroughly investigate this task, we systematically evaluate trending unlearning algorithms, revealing that current methods struggle to achieve effective entity-level unlearning. Then, we further explore the factors that influence the performance of the unlearning algorithms, identifying that knowledge coverage and the size of the forget set play pivotal roles. Notably, our analysis also uncovers that entities introduced through fine-tuning are more vulnerable to unlearning than pre-trained entities. These findings collectively offer valuable insights for advancing entity-level unlearning for LLMs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements have highlighted that large language models (LLMs), when given a small set of task-specific examples, demonstrate remarkable proficiency, a capability that extends to complex reasoning tasks. In particular, the combination of few-shot learning with the chain-of-thought (CoT) approach has been pivotal in steering models towards more logically consistent conclusions. This paper explores the optimization of example selection for designing effective CoT pre-prompts and shows that the choice of the optimization algorithm, typically in favor of comparison-based methods such as evolutionary computation, significantly enhances efficacy and feasibility. Specifically, thanks to a limited exploitative and overfitted optimization, Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) brings an improvement over the naive few-shot approach exceeding 10 absolute points in exact match scores on benchmark datasets such as GSM8k and MathQA. These gains are consistent across various contexts and are further amplified when integrated with self-consistency (SC)

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive results in multiple domains of natural language processing (NLP) but are mainly focused on the English language. Recently, more LLMs have incorporated a larger proportion of multilingual text to represent low-resource languages. In Arabic NLP, several Arabic-centric LLMs have shown remarkable results on multiple benchmarks in the past two years. However, most Arabic LLMs have more than 7 billion parameters, which increases their hardware requirements and inference latency, when compared to smaller LLMs. This paper introduces Arabic Stable LM 1.6B in a base and chat version as a small but powerful Arabic-centric LLM. Our Arabic Stable LM 1.6B chat model achieves impressive results on several benchmarks beating multiple models with up to 8x the parameters. In addition, we show the benefit of mixing in synthetic instruction tuning data by augmenting our fine-tuning data with a large synthetic dialogue dataset.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As command-line interfaces remain an integral part of high-computation environments, the risk of exploitation through stealthy, complex command-line abuse continues to grow. Conventional security solutions often struggle with these command-line-based anomalies due to their context-specific nature and lack of labeled data, especially in detecting rare, malicious patterns amidst legitimate, high-volume activity. This gap has left organizations vulnerable to sophisticated threats like Living-off-the-Land (LOL) attacks, where standard detection tools frequently miss or misclassify anomalous command-line behavior. We introduce Scalable Command-Line Anomaly Detection Engine (SCADE), who addresses these challenges by introducing a dual-layered detection framework that combines a global statistical analysis with local context-specific anomaly detection, innovatively using a novel ensemble of statistical models such as BM25 and Log Entropy, adapted for command-line data. The framework also features a dynamic thresholding mechanism for adaptive anomaly detection, ensuring high precision and recall even in environments with extremely high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Initial experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving above 98% SNR in identifying unusual command-line behavior while minimizing false positives. In this paper, we present SCADE's core architecture, including its metadata-enriched approach to anomaly detection and the design choices behind its scalability for enterprise-level deployment. We argue that SCADE represents a significant advancement in command-line anomaly detection, offering a robust, adaptive framework for security analysts and researchers seeking to enhance detection accuracy in high-computation environments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for layout generation due to their ability to produce structure-description languages, such as HTML or JSON, even without access to visual information. Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with the Gemini. Without any additional training, VASCAR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality outperforming both existing layout-specific generative models and other LLM-based methods.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties are under-served by language technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). This trend threatens to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limits language modeling applications, yet the research community lacks operationalized LLM performance measurements in DA. We present a method that comprehensively evaluates LLM fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia in modeling DA. We evaluate nine LLMs in eight DA varieties across these four dimensions and provide best practice recommendations. Our evaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it, but does not suggest deterioration in quality when they do. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can degrade DA capabilities, that few-shot examples can overcome this and other LLM deficiencies, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate well with LLM DA performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Adaptive networks today rely on overparameterized fixed topologies that cannot break through the statistical conflicts they encounter in the data they are exposed to, and are prone to "catastrophic forgetting" as the network attempts to reuse the existing structures to learn new task. We propose a structural adaptation method, DIRAD, that can complexify as needed and in a directed manner without being limited by statistical conflicts within a dataset. We then extend this method and present the PREVAL framework, designed to prevent "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning by detection of new data and assigning encountered data to suitable models adapted to process them, without needing task labels anywhere in the workflow. We show the reliability of the DIRAD in growing a network with high performance and orders-of-magnitude simpler than fixed topology networks; and demonstrate the proof-of-concept operation of PREVAL, in which continual adaptation to new tasks is observed while being able to detect and discern previously-encountered tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Background: Over the past few decades, the process and methodology of automated question generation (AQG) have undergone significant transformations. Recent progress in generative natural language models has opened up new potential in the generation of educational content.   Objectives: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating computer science questions that are sufficiently annotated for automatic learner model updates, are fully situated in the context of a particular course, and address the cognitive dimension understand.   Methods: Unlike previous attempts that might use basic methods like ChatGPT, our approach involves more targeted strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful learning objects.   Results and Conclusions: Our results show that generating structural, semantic annotations works well. However, this success was not reflected in the case of relational annotations. The quality of the generated questions often did not meet educational standards, highlighting that although LLMs can contribute to the pool of learning materials, their current level of performance requires significant human intervention to refine and validate the generated content.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various tasks, but deploying them for inference poses challenges. Their high resource demands often necessitate complex, costly multi-GPU pipelines, or the use of smaller, less capable models. While quantization offers a promising solution utilizing lower precision for model storage, existing methods frequently experience significant performance drops at lower precision levels. Additionally, they typically provide only a limited set of solutions at specific bit levels, many of which are extensively manually tuned. To address these challenges, we propose a new method called SKIM: Scaled K-means clustering wIth Mixed precision. Our approach introduces two novel techniques: 1. A greedy algorithm to solve approximately optimal bit allocation across weight channels, and 2. A trainable scaling vector for non-differentiable K-means clustering. These techniques substantially improve performance and can be adapted to any given bit. Notably, in terms of model perplexity, our method narrows the gap between 3-bit quantized LLaMA models and their full precision counterparts by 16.3% on average.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are key technologies driving intelligent systems to handle multiple tasks. To meet the demands of various tasks, an increasing number of LLMs-driven experts with diverse capabilities have been developed, accompanied by corresponding benchmarks to evaluate their performance. This paper proposes the Bench-CoE framework, which enables Collaboration of Experts (CoE) by effectively leveraging benchmark evaluations to achieve optimal performance across various tasks. Bench-CoE includes a set of expert models, a router for assigning tasks to corresponding experts, and a benchmark dataset for training the router. Moreover, we formulate Query-Level and Subject-Level approaches based on our framework, and analyze the merits and drawbacks of these two approaches. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments with vary data distributions on both language and multimodal tasks to validate that our proposed Bench-CoE outperforms any single model in terms of overall performance. We hope this method serves as a baseline for further research in this area. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ZhangXJ199/Bench-CoE}.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The EU AI Act was created to ensure ethical and safe Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and deployment across the EU. This study aims to identify key challenges and strategies for helping enterprises focus on resources effectively. To achieve this aim, we conducted a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) to explore the sentiments of both the industry and the academia. From 130 articles, 56 met the criteria. Our key findings are three-fold. First, liability. Second, discrimination. Third, tool adequacy. Additionally, some negative sentiments were expressed by industry and academia regarding regulatory interpretations, specific requirements, and transparency issues. Next, our findings are three essential themes for enterprises. First, risk-based regulatory compliance. Second, ethical frameworks and principles in technology development. Third, policies and systems for regulatory risk management. These results identify the key challenges and strategies and provide less commonly discussed themes, enabling enterprises to align with the requirements and minimize their distance from the EU market.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities beyond language generation to interact with external systems through tool calling, offering powerful potential for real-world applications. However, the phenomenon of tool hallucinations, which occur when models improperly select or misuse tools, presents critical challenges that can lead to flawed task execution and increased operational costs. This paper investigates the concept of reliable tool calling and highlights the necessity of addressing tool hallucinations. We systematically categorize tool hallucinations into two main types: tool selection hallucination and tool usage hallucination. To mitigate these issues, we propose a reliability-focused alignment framework that enhances the model's ability to accurately assess tool relevance and usage. By proposing a suite of evaluation metrics and evaluating on StableToolBench, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating tool hallucination and improving the overall system reliability of LLM tool calling.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance} mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust} model behavior.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become a critical objective of model developers. In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In this paper, we examine the impact of lexicalization on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD). It is well known that one of the key challenges in interpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging the lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct vocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is explicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect to the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the performance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA system that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner to infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that such a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current QA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score compared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and potential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that LLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal improvements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that LLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of the meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken together, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the importance of lexicalization and compositionality.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We address multi-view pedestrian detection in a setting where labeled data is collected using a multi-camera setup different from the one used for testing. While recent multi-view pedestrian detectors perform well on the camera rig used for training, their performance declines when applied to a different setup. To facilitate seamless deployment across varied camera rigs, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method that adapts the model to new rigs without requiring additional labeled data. Specifically, we leverage the mean teacher self-training framework with a novel pseudo-labeling technique tailored to multi-view pedestrian detection. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including MultiviewX$\rightarrow$Wildtrack. Unlike previous methods, our approach eliminates the need for external labeled monocular datasets, thereby reducing reliance on labeled data. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate key design choices. By enabling robust adaptation across camera setups, our work enhances the practicality of multi-view pedestrian detectors and establishes a strong UDA baseline for future research.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose utilizing background operators for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we define a set of fundamental mathematical predicates as the basic building blocks. For each mathematical problem, we develop a Prolog solution that includes problem-specific predicates and intermediate predicates derived from these background operators, ensuring that each solution adheres to the defined operator set. We introduce the MATH-Prolog corpus, which is derived from the counting and probability categories of the MATH corpus. For efficient data augmentation, we apply K-fold cross-validated self-training. This method incrementally generates new Prolog solutions for each fold, incorporating those verified as correct into the training set throughout the model training process. Our experimental results demonstrate that 5-fold crossvalidated self-training effectively identifies new, accurate Prolog solutions, achieving an accuracy of 84.6% on the cross-validated set, and 84.8% on the test set during fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. This approach successfully uncovers new solutions with fully computable inference steps for previously unseen problems. Additionally, incorporating the background mathematical predicates into the prompt enhances solution coverage.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to model the sequential dependencies in users' historical interactions to better capture their evolving interests. However, existing SR approaches primarily rely on collaborative data, which leads to limitations such as the cold-start problem and sub-optimal performance. Meanwhile, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), their application in industrial recommender systems is hindered by high inference latency, inability to capture all distribution statistics, and catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose a novel Pre-train, Align, and Disentangle (PAD) paradigm to empower recommendation models with LLMs. Specifically, we first pre-train both the SR and LLM models to get collaborative and textual embeddings. Next, a characteristic recommendation-anchored alignment loss is proposed using multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy with Gaussian kernels. Finally, a triple-experts architecture, consisting aligned and modality-specific experts with disentangled embeddings, is fine-tuned in a frequency-aware manner. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PAD, showing significant improvements and compatibility with various SR backbone models, especially on cold items. The implementation code and datasets will be publicly available.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> As the strength of Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown over recent years, so too has interest in their use as the underlying models for autonomous agents. Although LLMs demonstrate emergent abilities and broad expertise across natural language domains, their inherent unpredictability makes the implementation of LLM agents challenging, resulting in a gap between related research and the real-world implementation of such systems. To bridge this gap, this paper frames actionable insights and considerations from the research community in the context of established application paradigms to enable the construction and facilitate the informed deployment of robust LLM agents. Namely, we position relevant research findings into four broad categories--Planning, Memory, Tools, and Control Flow--based on common practices in application-focused literature and highlight practical considerations to make when designing agentic LLMs for real-world applications, such as handling stochasticity and managing resources efficiently. While we do not conduct empirical evaluations, we do provide the necessary background for discussing critical aspects of agentic LLM designs, both in academia and industry.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss. which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent. Code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/lbc12345/LossAgent.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating program code, opening exciting opportunities for applying program synthesis to games. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, but their output may not be aligned with the user or even produce harmful content. This paper presents a novel approach to detect and steer concepts such as toxicity before generation. We introduce the Sparse Conditioned Autoencoder (SCAR), a single trained module that extends the otherwise untouched LLM. SCAR ensures full steerability, towards and away from concepts (e.g., toxic content), without compromising the quality of the model's text generation on standard evaluation benchmarks. We demonstrate the effective application of our approach through a variety of concepts, including toxicity, safety, and writing style alignment. As such, this work establishes a robust framework for controlling LLM generations, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment in real-world applications.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social interactions are fundamental to human life. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs)-based virtual assistants has demonstrated their potential to revolutionize human interactions and lifestyles. However, existing assistive systems mainly provide reactive services to individual users, rather than offering in-situ assistance during live social interactions with conversational partners. In this study, we introduce SocialMind, the first LLM-based proactive AR social assistive system that provides users with in-situ social assistance. SocialMind employs human-like perception leveraging multi-modal sensors to extract both verbal and nonverbal cues, social factors, and implicit personas, incorporating these social cues into LLM reasoning for social suggestion generation. Additionally, SocialMind employs a multi-tier collaborative generation strategy and proactive update mechanism to display social suggestions on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, ensuring that suggestions are timely provided to users without disrupting the natural flow of conversation. Evaluations on three public datasets and a user study with 20 participants show that SocialMind achieves 38.3% higher engagement compared to baselines, and 95% of participants are willing to use SocialMind in their live social interactions.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents profound challenges to societal safety. As AI systems become more capable, accessible, and integrated into critical services, the dual nature of their potential is increasingly clear. While AI can enhance defensive capabilities in areas like threat detection, risk assessment, and automated security operations, it also presents avenues for malicious exploitation and large-scale societal harm, for example through automated influence operations and cyber attacks. Understanding the dynamics that shape AI's capacity to both cause harm and enhance protective measures is essential for informed decision-making regarding the deployment, use, and integration of advanced AI systems. This paper builds on recent work on offense-defense dynamics within the realm of AI, proposing a taxonomy to map and examine the key factors that influence whether AI systems predominantly pose threats or offer protective benefits to society. By establishing a shared terminology and conceptual foundation for analyzing these interactions, this work seeks to facilitate further research and discourse in this critical area.

While traditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long documents, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model performance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation (Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed. However, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both aspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating semantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to predict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar queries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior performance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context lengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model sizes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years; however, their excellent performance is still largely limited to major world languages, primarily English. Many LLMs continue to face challenges with multilingual tasks, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduced Marco-LLM: Massive multilingual training for cross-lingual enhancement LLM. We have collected a substantial amount of multilingual data for several low-resource languages and conducted extensive continual pre-training using the Qwen2 models. This effort has resulted in a multilingual LLM named Marco-LLM. Through comprehensive evaluations on various multilingual benchmarks, including MMMLU, AGIEval, Belebele, Flores-200, XCOPA and many others, Marco-LLM has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, Marco-LLM achieved substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks, showing the effectiveness of our multilingual LLM. Marco-LLM is a pioneering multilingual LLM designed to not only perform exceptionally well in multilingual tasks, including low-resource languages, but also maintain strong performance in English and other major languages, closing the performance gap between high- and low-resource language capabilities. By bridging languages, this effort demonstrates our dedication to ensuring LLMs work accurately across various languages.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Numerous crucial tasks in real-world decision-making rely on machine learning algorithms with calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Surveys are widely used in social sciences to understand human behavior, but their implementation often involves iterative adjustments that demand significant effort and resources. To this end, researchers have increasingly turned to large language models (LLMs) to simulate human behavior. While existing studies have focused on distributional similarities, individual-level comparisons remain underexplored. Building upon prior work, we investigate whether providing LLMs with respondents' prior information can replicate both statistical distributions and individual decision-making patterns using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), a well-established causal analysis method. We also introduce the concept of the LLM-Mirror, user personas generated by supplying respondent-specific information to the LLM. By comparing responses generated by the LLM-Mirror with actual individual survey responses, we assess its effectiveness in replicating individual-level outcomes. Our findings show that: (1) PLS-SEM analysis shows LLM-generated responses align with human responses, (2) LLMs, when provided with respondent-specific information, are capable of reproducing individual human responses, and (3) LLM-Mirror responses closely follow human responses at the individual level. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a complementary tool for pre-testing surveys and optimizing research design.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown limitations in tasks requiring complex logical reasoning and multi-step problem-solving. To address these challenges, researchers have employed carefully designed prompts and flowcharts, simulating human cognitive processes to enhance LLM performance, such as the Chain of Thought approach. In this paper, we introduce MTMT (Multi-thinking Modes Tree), a novel method that interacts with LLMs to construct a thought tree, simulating various advanced cognitive processes, including but not limited to association, counterfactual thinking, task decomposition, and comparison. By breaking down the original complex task into simpler sub-questions, MTMT facilitates easier problem-solving for LLMs, enabling more effective utilization of the latent knowledge within LLMs. We evaluate the performance of MTMT under different parameter configurations, using GPT-4o mini as the base model. Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple modes of thinking significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents a comprehensive chatbot system designed to handle a wide range of audio-related queries by integrating multiple specialized audio processing models. The proposed system uses an intent classifier, trained on a diverse audio query dataset, to route queries about audio content to expert models such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speaker Diarization, Music Identification, and Text-to-Audio generation. A 3.8 B LLM model then takes inputs from an Audio Context Detection (ACD) module extracting audio event information from the audio and post processes text domain outputs from the expert models to compute the final response to the user. We evaluated the system on custom audio tasks and MMAU sound set benchmarks. The custom datasets were motivated by target use cases not covered in industry benchmarks and included ACD-timestamp-QA (Question Answering) as well as ACD-temporal-QA datasets to evaluate timestamp and temporal reasoning questions, respectively. First we determined that a BERT based Intent Classifier outperforms LLM-fewshot intent classifier in routing queries. Experiments further show that our approach significantly improves accuracy on some custom tasks compared to state-of-the-art Large Audio Language Models and outperforms models in the 7B parameter size range on the sound testset of the MMAU benchmark, thereby offering an attractive option for on device deployment.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Diversity in demonstration selection is crucial for enhancing model generalization, as it enables a broader coverage of structures and concepts. However, constructing an appropriate set of demonstrations has remained a focal point of research. This paper presents the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for text classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs a Q-learning framework to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity and relevance to the classification objective by calculating a diversity score based on label distribution among selected demonstrations. This method ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved classification accuracy. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and involving 12 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to ten established baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the incorporation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the reasoning process, which further enhances the model's predictive performance. The results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to facilitate adaptive demonstration selection and deepen the understanding of classification challenges.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Chain-of-Thought prompting has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with numerous studies exploring factors influencing its performance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To further demystify the operational principles, this work examines three key aspects: decoding, projection, and activation, aiming to elucidate the changes that occur within models when employing Chainof-Thought. Our findings reveal that LLMs effectively imitate exemplar formats while integrating them with their understanding of the question, exhibiting fluctuations in token logits during generation but ultimately producing a more concentrated logits distribution, and activating a broader set of neurons in the final layers, indicating more extensive knowledge retrieval compared to standard prompts. Our code and data will be publicly avialable when the paper is accepted.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Apparel is essential to human life, offering protection, mirroring cultural identities, and showcasing personal style. Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a large multimodal model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of powerful text generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), which are widely used for diverse applications. However, concerns surrounding AI-generated content, including issues of originality, bias, misinformation, and accountability, have become increasingly prominent. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of AI text generators (AITGs), focusing on their evolution, capabilities, and ethical implications. This paper also introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a recent approach that improves the contextual relevance and accuracy of text generation by integrating dynamic information retrieval. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional models, including their reliance on static knowledge and potential inaccuracies in handling real-world data. Additionally, the paper reviews detection tools that help differentiate AI-generated text from human-written content and discusses the ethical challenges these technologies pose. The paper explores future directions for improving detection accuracy, supporting ethical AI development, and increasing accessibility.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an online platform showing Thailand solar irradiance map every 30 minutes, available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models exhibit comparable overall MAE performance to the service X. The best model is LightGBM with an overall MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm, while the service X achieves the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MBE in cloudy condition. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for the whole Thailand region is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance in MAE of 78.67 W/sqm. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit spontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are removed. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized. These enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by extensive experiments.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In vision-language models (VLMs), the ability to perceive and interpret color and physical environment is crucial for achieving contextually accurate understanding and interaction. However, despite advances in multimodal modeling, there remains a significant lack of specialized datasets that rigorously evaluate a model's capacity to discern subtle color variations and spatial context -- critical elements for situational comprehension and reliable deployment across real-world applications. Toward that goal, we curate MegaCOIN, a high-quality, human-labeled dataset based on \emph{real} images with various contextual attributes. MegaCOIN consists of two parts: MegaCOIN-Instruct, which serves as a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLMs; and MegaCOIN-Bench, an annotated test set that can be used as a stand-alone QA dataset. MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000 real images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's physical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition, MegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We explore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show some new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o, have subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can result in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases, MegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can outperform closed-source GPT-4o. We hope the utilities of MegaCOIN can shed light on the directions VLMs can improve and provide a more complex platform for domain generalization algorithms.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Existing evaluations of tool learning primarily focus on validating the alignment of selected tools for large language models (LLMs) with expected outcomes. However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where answers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a sole emphasis on outcomes disregards the complex capabilities required for LLMs to effectively use tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a fine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning capabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven real-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool learning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool selection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool library boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between LLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three categories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive abilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even exacerbates the hindrance to tool learning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/ToolEyes.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Question answering represents a core capability of large language models (LLMs). However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRS improves the reformulation accuracy of GPT-3.5 from 23.03% to 70.42%, while also enhancing the performance of open-source models, such as Gemma2-9B, from 26.35% to 56.75%.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. By reflecting on the current research and identifying future research directions, this survey provides insights to advance the development and evaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Deep learning techniques have proven highly effective in image classification, but their deployment in resourceconstrained environments remains challenging due to high computational demands. Furthermore, their interpretability is of high importance which demands even more available resources. In this work, we introduce an approach that combines saliency-guided training with quantization techniques to create an interpretable and resource-efficient model without compromising accuracy. We utilize Parameterized Clipping Activation (PACT) to perform quantization-aware training, specifically targeting activations and weights to optimize precision while minimizing resource usage. Concurrently, saliency-guided training is employed to enhance interpretability by iteratively masking features with low gradient values, leading to more focused and meaningful saliency maps. This training procedure helps in mitigating noisy gradients and yields models that provide clearer, more interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. To evaluate the impact of our approach, we conduct experiments using famous Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets as two popular datasets. We compare the saliency maps generated by standard and quantized models to assess the influence of quantization on both interpretability and classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of saliency-guided training and PACT-based quantization not only maintains classification performance but also produces models that are significantly more efficient and interpretable, making them suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Block pruning, which eliminates contiguous blocks of weights, is a structural pruning method that can significantly enhance the performance of neural processing units (NPUs). In industrial applications, an ideal block pruning algorithm should meet three key requirements: (1) maintain high accuracy across diverse models and tasks, as machine learning deployments on edge devices are typically accuracy-critical; (2) offer precise control over resource constraints to facilitate user adoption; and (3) provide convergence guarantees to prevent performance instability. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing block pruning algorithm satisfies all three requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce SMART (Separate, Dynamic, and Differentiable) pruning, a novel algorithm designed to address this gap. SMART leverages both weight and activation information to enhance accuracy, employs a differentiable top-k operator for precise control of resource constraints, and offers convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Extensive experiments involving seven models, four datasets, three different block types, and three computer vision tasks demonstrate that SMART pruning achieves state-of-the-art performance in block pruning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a suite of tasks to evaluate the instrumental self-reasoning ability of large language model (LLM) agents. Instrumental self-reasoning ability could improve adaptability and enable self-modification, but it could also pose significant risks, such as enabling deceptive alignment. Prior work has only evaluated self-reasoning in non-agentic settings or in limited domains. In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning ability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate agents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source systems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the most capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model passes the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation can be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in future models. We open-source our evaluations at https://github.com/kaifronsdal/Self-Reasoning-Evals.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> The task of condensing large chunks of textual information into concise and structured tables has gained attention recently due to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential benefit for downstream tasks, such as text summarization and text mining. Previous approaches often generate tables that directly replicate information from the text, limiting their applicability in broader contexts, as text-to-table generation in real-life scenarios necessitates information extraction, reasoning, and integration. However, there is a lack of both datasets and methodologies towards this task. In this paper, we introduce LiveSum, a new benchmark dataset created for generating summary tables of competitions based on real-time commentary texts. We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art LLMs on this task in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, and additionally propose a novel pipeline called $T^3$(Text-Tuple-Table) to improve their performances. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LLMs still struggle with this task even after fine-tuning, while our approach can offer substantial performance gains without explicit training. Further analyses demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization abilities, surpassing previous approaches on several other text-to-table datasets. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/LiveSum.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Integrated Gradients is a well-known technique for explaining deep learning models. It calculates feature importance scores by employing a gradient based approach computing gradients of the model output with respect to input features and accumulating them along a linear path. While this works well for continuous features spaces, it may not be the most optimal way to deal with discrete spaces like word embeddings. For interpreting LLMs (Large Language Models), there exists a need for a non-linear path where intermediate points, whose gradients are to be computed, lie close to actual words in the embedding space. In this paper, we propose a method called Uniform Discretized Integrated Gradients (UDIG) based on a new interpolation strategy where we choose a favorable nonlinear path for computing attribution scores suitable for predictive language models. We evaluate our method on two types of NLP tasks- Sentiment Classification and Question Answering against three metrics viz Log odds, Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. For sentiment classification, we have used the SST2, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes datasets for benchmarking and for Question Answering, we have used the fine-tuned BERT model on SQuAD dataset. Our approach outperforms the existing methods in almost all the metrics.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> E-commerce is rapidly transforming economies across Africa, offering immense opportunities for economic growth, market expansion, and digital inclusion. This study investigates the effects of e-commerce on select African regions. By utilizing readiness factors, including mobile money deployment, GDP per capita, internet penetration, and digital infrastructure, the preparedness of African countries for e-commerce adoption is quantified, highlighting significant disparities. Through case studies in urban and rural areas, including Lagos, Kano, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley, the study shows e-commerce's significant effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employment, and market efficiency. Urban centers demonstrated significant gains in productivity and profitability, whereas rural regions experienced slower growth due to limited internet access and infrastructural barriers. Despite these challenges, localized solutions such as mobile money systems and agricultural e-commerce platforms are bridging gaps. This study highlights the significant potential of e-commerce in Africa while emphasizing the need for targeted investments and strategies to address existing regional disparities.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the dominant method for parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning, with LoRA-based quantization error compensation (LQEC) emerging as a powerful tool for recovering accuracy in compressed LLMs. However, LQEC has underperformed in sub-4-bit scenarios, with no prior investigation into understanding this limitation. We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Addressing the disparity between forecasts and actual results can enable individuals to expand their thought processes and stimulate self-reflection, thus promoting accurate planning. In this research, we present **PreAct**, an agent framework that integrates **pre**diction, **rea**soning, and **act**ion. By utilizing the information derived from predictions, the large language model (LLM) agent can provide a wider range and more strategically focused reasoning. This leads to more efficient actions that aid the agent in accomplishing intricate tasks. Our experimental results show that PreAct surpasses the ReAct method in completing complex tasks and that PreAct's performance can be further improved when paired with other memory or selection strategy techniques. We presented the model with varying quantities of historical predictions and discovered that these predictions consistently enhance LLM planning.The variances in single-step reasoning between PreAct and ReAct indicate that PreAct indeed has benefits in terms of diversity and strategic orientation over ReAct.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Social networks fundamentally shape human opinions, behaviors, and the dissemination of information. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama increasingly integrate into social and professional settings, understanding their behavior in the context of social interactions and network formation becomes essential. This study develops a framework to systematically examine whether the network formation behaviors of multiple LLMs approximate certain aspects of human network dynamics. By simulating interactions among LLM agents across various model families, we observe that these models consistently exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics, reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate, capturing personal and professional connections, while in employment networks, LLMs favor heterophily and high-degree connections, aligning with career advancement dynamics. These results open new avenues for using LLMs in network science research, with potential applications in agent-based modeling and synthetic network generation.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. Additionally, the benefits of AI mentorship on self-reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduced Simulife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a Sage Agent, who acts as a bystander, providing users with some perspectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of non-cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within-subject user study, our quantitative results reveal that, when accompanied by Sage Agent, users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience & coping, along with an enhanced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally, our qualitative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoting reflection on non-cognitive skills, enhancing social communication and decision-making performance, and improving overall user experience within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Agent and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future potential of Sage Agent for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models. However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored. We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. We identified two main obstacles behind this issue. One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models. The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs. Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias. This allows us to integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly. Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework. Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework. We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DiT across model size and data size. Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6. The LLM-Infused Diffuser framework is also one of the core technologies powering SenseMirage, a highly advanced text-to-image model.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> E-learning environments are increasingly harnessing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tailored educational support. This study introduces an approach that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with LLMs to offer nuanced student assistance. By evaluating past and ongoing student interactions, the system identifies and appends the most salient learning context to prompts directed at the LLM. Central to this method is the knowledge graph's role in assessing a student's comprehension of topic prerequisites. Depending on the categorized understanding (good, average, or poor), the LLM adjusts its guidance, offering advanced assistance, foundational reviews, or in-depth prerequisite explanations, respectively. Preliminary findings suggest students could benefit from this tiered support, achieving enhanced comprehension and improved task outcomes. However, several issues related to potential errors arising from LLMs were identified, which can potentially mislead students. This highlights the need for human intervention to mitigate these risks. This research aims to advance AI-driven personalized learning while acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls, thus guiding future research in technology and data-driven education.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency. In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of using internal representations for self-evaluation of LLMs. Our code is available at github.com/zhxieml/internal-consistency.

To address these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent dialog system that combines educational and psychological counseling functions. The system consists of multiple AI agent, including security detection agent, intent identification agent, educational LLM agent, and psychological LLM agent, which work in concert to ensure the provision of accurate educational knowledge Q\&A and psychological support services. Specifically, the system recognizes user-input intentions through an intention classification model and invokes a retrieval-enhanced educational grand model and a psychological grand model fine-tuned with psychological data in order to provide professional educational advice and psychological support.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Confidential Computing has emerged to address data security challenges in cloud-centric deployments by protecting data in use through hardware-level isolation. However, reliance on a single hardware root of trust (RoT) limits user confidence in cloud platforms, especially for high-performance AI services, where end-to-end protection of sensitive models and data is critical. Furthermore, the lack of interoperability and a unified trust model in multi-cloud environments prevents the establishment of a cross-platform, cross-cloud chain of trust, creating a significant trust gap for users with high privacy requirements. To address the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes CCxTrust (Confidential Computing with Trust), a confidential computing platform leveraging collaborative roots of trust from TEE and TPM. CCxTrust combines the black-box RoT embedded in the CPU-TEE with the flexible white-box RoT of TPM to establish a collaborative trust framework. The platform implements independent Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTM) for TEE and TPM, and a collaborative Root of Trust for Report (RTR) for composite attestation. The Root of Trust for Storage (RTS) is solely supported by TPM. We also present the design and implementation of a confidential TPM supporting multiple modes for secure use within confidential virtual machines. Additionally, we propose a composite attestation protocol integrating TEE and TPM to enhance security and attestation efficiency, which is proven secure under the PCL protocol security model. We implemented a prototype of CCxTrust on a confidential computing server with AMD SEV-SNP and TPM chips, requiring minimal modifications to the TPM and guest Linux kernel. The composite attestation efficiency improved by 24% without significant overhead, while Confidential TPM performance showed a 16.47% reduction compared to standard TPM.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> In 2023, Sonatype reported a 200\% increase in software supply chain attacks, including major build infrastructure attacks. To secure the software supply chain, practitioners can follow security framework guidance like the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA). However, recent surveys and industry summits have shown that despite growing interest, the adoption of SLSA is not widespread. To understand adoption challenges, \textit{the goal of this study is to aid framework authors and practitioners in improving the adoption and development of Supply-Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) through a qualitative study of SLSA-related issues on GitHub}. We analyzed 1,523 SLSA-related issues extracted from 233 GitHub repositories. We conducted a topic-guided thematic analysis, leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to explore the challenges of adopting SLSA and the strategies for overcoming these challenges. We identified four significant challenges and five suggested adoption strategies. The two main challenges reported are complex implementation and unclear communication, highlighting the difficulties in implementing and understanding the SLSA process across diverse ecosystems. The suggested strategies include streamlining provenance generation processes, improving the SLSA verification process, and providing specific and detailed documentation. Our findings indicate that some strategies can help mitigate multiple challenges, and some challenges need future research and tool enhancement.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large-scale pretrained models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in handling multiple tasks across domains due to their emergent properties. These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability performances during training. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains including law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the training process, domain weights are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant improvements in multi-domain performance, with an 35.21% enhancement in comprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific domain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of performance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target domain's training efficacy.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via public-facing interfaces to interact with millions of users, each with diverse preferences. Despite this, preference tuning of LLMs predominantly relies on reward models trained using binary judgments where annotators select the preferred choice out of pairs of model outputs. In this work, we argue that this reliance on binary choices does not capture the broader, aggregate preferences of the target user in real-world tasks. We propose a taxonomy that identifies two dimensions of subjectivity where different users disagree on the preferred output-namely, the Plurality of Responses to Prompts, where prompts allow for multiple correct answers, and the Indistinguishability of Responses, where candidate outputs are paraphrases of each other. We show that reward models correlate weakly with user preferences in these cases. As a first step to address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method that augments existing binary preference datasets with synthetic preference judgments to estimate potential user disagreement. Incorporating these via a margin term as a form of regularization during model training yields predictions that better align with the aggregate user preferences.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Software repositories contain valuable information for gaining insights into their development process. However, extracting insights from these repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots have been developed to facilitate natural language interactions with repositories, they struggle with understanding natural language and accurately retrieving relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We achieve this in a two-step approach; (1) constructing a knowledge graph from the repository data and (2) synergizing the knowledge graph with LLM to allow for the natural language questions and answers. We curated a set of 20 questions with different complexities and evaluated our approach on five popular open-source projects. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 65%. We further investigated the limitations and identified six key issues, with the majority relating to the reasoning capability of the LLM. We experimented with a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to determine if it could enhance our approach. This technique improved the overall accuracy to 84%. Our findings demonstrate the synergy between LLMs and knowledge graphs as a viable solution for making repository data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

                    <strong>Summary:</strong> Image editing technologies are tools used to transform, adjust, remove, or otherwise alter images. Recent research has significantly improved the capabilities of image editing tools, enabling the creation of photorealistic and semantically informed forged regions that are nearly indistinguishable from authentic imagery, presenting new challenges in digital forensics and media credibility. While current image forensic techniques are adept at localizing forged regions produced by traditional image manipulation methods, current capabilities struggle to localize regions created by diffusion-based techniques. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework that integrates a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) for enhanced reasoning capabilities to localize tampered regions in images produced by diffusion model-based editing methods. By leveraging the contextual and semantic strengths of LLMs, our framework achieves promising results on MagicBrush, AutoSplice, and PerfBrush (novel diffusion-based dataset) datasets, outperforming previous approaches in mIoU and F1-score metrics. Notably, our method excels on the PerfBrush dataset, a self-constructed test set featuring previously unseen types of edits. Here, where traditional methods typically falter, achieving markedly low scores, our approach demonstrates promising performance.
